         	<p>Let me start with a question, do businesses care more about disability than the Church? Perhaps some do, but it‚Äôs much more likely that many adaptations are made due to obligations and carefully planned and costed strategy.</p><p>Should the church follow suit? Does it already? Some churches operate as a business, with a large staff and budget who can be fully aware of and actively pursue accessibility compliance, so what sets them apart from companies like Coca Cola, or Apple?</p><p>One of the things I‚Äôve learnt, especially in the last few years, has been the importance of empathy. This Christ-like heart is the one great advantage that the Church has over the world.</p><p>When it comes to adapting to disability, <strong>businesses have regulations, but families have needs</strong>. We certainly weren‚Äôt prepared for a child with special needs; we had to adapt quickly and still are. We had to learn fast, change on the fly and learn not be disappointed when things inevitably didn‚Äôt go to plan. Sometimes we might learn from the example of others, other times it‚Äôs Petey himself who teaches us, like when he sat on stage for 45 minutes at his nursery school nativity and took part in every song.</p><p>Families have needs. What is the Church if not a family?</p><p>Just as we weren‚Äôt prepared, it‚Äôs ok that the Church isn‚Äôt either.</p><blockquote><p>If you don‚Äôt have have congregants in wheelchairs then there‚Äôs no need to put an ugly wheelchair ramp out front?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If no one in your church suffers from epilepsy, are strobe lights and laser shows during worship fine?</p></blockquote><p>These statements might be true for you and that‚Äôs ok! The important thing is that we are aware of others, sensitive of their needs and have empathy with them.</p><p>While it‚Äôs easy to think that we don‚Äôt have congregants with a specific need and therefore don‚Äôt need to make adaptations, chances are we don‚Äôt have those people because they‚Äôve went elsewhere, or worse, nowhere.</p><p>More than anything the Church needs to reveal the Father‚Äôs heart to the community; it‚Äôs ok to not be prepared as long as we have love. We‚Äôve already talked about how difficult it is for us and for other families of children with special needs, to do something new. Almost a year go we came here, to morning service backed up by nothing but Google and prayer and were welcomed and loved immediately. We didn‚Äôt judge the church because they didn‚Äôt meet every single of of Petey‚Äôs needs, because how could they prepare for a child they‚Äôd never met.</p><p>That‚Äôs not to say that we‚Äôd just visit anywhere. What brought us to our current church was prayer and Google. We had to make a shortlist of churches that had certain facilities and at least one was dropped from the list for having no useful information on their website.</p><p>I could talk for another hour about the importance of having a relevant church website but you‚Äôll be glad to know that now is not that time! A church website only can take you so far, to the door. What made us stay, even in the face of David McBride‚Äôs hugs, even when people didn‚Äôt completely understand, was that we felt accepted and loved.</p><p><strong>What good is the great commission without love? If we go in obligation and not love, then what good can we do?</strong></p><p>The Church is stronger as a family. As family we can adapt to changing needs through love and as a family we can bring the kingdom to <em>all</em> around us.</p><p> <em>This article was originally published as a podcast, for <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gracecommunitychurch/autism-and-the-church-andrew-and-lila-gribben">Grace Community Church</a>.</em> </p>

<blockquote></p>

<pre><code>    The W3C announced today the latest in a series of workshops exploring the¬†capabilities needed to ensure that the Web delivers on its full potential as a universal platform for digital publishing.
</code></pre>

<p>The upcoming technical workshop will¬†be held September 18-19 in Tokyo, Japan. It will focus on evaluating¬†the current status and exploring future directions of visually-rich long-form digital publications based on Web Technologies (particularly CSS, the formatting language of the Web), encompassing both fixed and dynamic layouts.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>At first glance people with Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Depression or Anxiety may appear &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, leading to that all too common moment when we suddenly realise and quickly followed by us becoming awkward and uncomfortable; unsure of how to behave around them. The end result? Adults may ignore the person altogether while children may resort to insults or bullying. For the person with the disability just leaving home can become a massive challenge; an obstacle course of uncertainty and judgement that you have to navigate whilst carrying a ticking time-bomb.</p>

<p>A few years ago I used to dread going to church. Trying to handle that with a toddler with ASD was just too much. There was nothing motivating me beyond obligation and even that wasn&rsquo;t enough when a simple trip to Tesco could be as tiring as a day out.</p>

<p>If I was to ask ask you to think about people in the Bible who have a disability we&rsquo;d probably end up with the same list of obvious candidates, but there are others that don&rsquo;t often get considered because perhaps their disability isn&rsquo;t outwardly visible or immediately apparent.</p>

<p>One example was a man who was called of God to carry out a very important task. To the outside world he was well educated, rugged and probably had an epic beard. He had no statement of special needs, or parking permit but when given a mission for God he argued with Jehovah himself saying that he couldn&rsquo;t do it. Not arguing against the seemingly impossible task at hand but that he just couldn&rsquo;t say the words God wanted him to speak. That man was Moses</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 4:10,15<br />
But Moses said to the Lord, ‚ÄúOh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, but I am slow of speech and of tongue.‚Äù
You shall speak to him [Aaron] and put the words in his mouth, and I will be with your mouth and with his mouth and will teach you both what to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&rsquo;t normally think of Moses as having a disability and people may say &ldquo;it was in his mind&rdquo; mental illness is a real problem and for Moses it was so big that God had to send Aaron, Moses&rsquo; brother, to speak on his behalf.</p>

<p>Throughout history people who suffered a neurological or developmental disability were seen as unsafe, possible criminals and best to be avoided and t&rsquo;s very easy for that sort of negative attitude or bigotry to spread. In Bible, time and time again we see shocking examples of bigotry in how society&rsquo;s outcasts were treated. People continually took customs into law and then turned it up to 11.</p>

<p>People often wonder what Jesus looks like, I imagine most of the time it was like this:
‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
After all he spent a great deal of his ministry course correcting daft customs that followed that letter of law but forsook empathy.</p>

<p>One really interesting example of bigotry in the Bible comes from an unlikely source. Job, destitute, penniless, sick and alone and with some of the worst friends in history contemplates his lot.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Job 30:1-12<br />
But now they laugh at me, men who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.
What could I gain from the strength of their hands, men whose vigor is gone?
Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation; they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes, and the roots of the broom tree for their food.
They are driven out from human company; they shout after them as after a thief.
In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks.
Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together.
A senseless, a nameless brood, they have been whipped out of the land.
And now I have become their song;
I am a byword to them.
They abhor me; they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me.
Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence.
On my right hand the rabble rise; they push away my feet; they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is Job, a man described as &ldquo;a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?‚Äù in Job 1:8 outraged that the outcasts of society mock his situation. This same Job in Job 29:12-16 says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban.
I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can a man who has done all these good works, a man that God says is blameless, have such an attitude of elitism even now?</p>

<p>Job compares these people to criminals, which suggests that they aren&rsquo;t. Job 30:2 describes them as &ldquo;men whose vigor is gone&rdquo;, being unable to work with your hands in an agrarian society would certainly be classed as disability and not being able to work would lead to homelessness and exclusion from community. Job&rsquo;s discrimination may not be out of malice, but based on social norms. That doesn&rsquo;t excuse it but it also doesn&rsquo;t mean that God will rebuke him for it.</p>

<p>Instead God takes a different approach.</p>

<p>Starting at chapter 38, God begins to work on Job. Not just to lift up his spirits but to set right as heart. By the end of the book, Job&rsquo;s family and livelihood have been restored, but curiously there is no mention of his health. We don&rsquo;t know if Job was healed but by the end of the book that&rsquo;s no longer important. Although it was never the point of his suffering, Job&rsquo;s situation and corresponding time with God, teaches him empathy to the point where his ability no longer mattered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Job 42:5<br />
I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Job&rsquo;s relationship with God changes and deepens, before he could only hear God, now he can see him too; he learns to have a heart like the Father.</p>

<p>We will likely all suffer disability in our lives at some point. For some it might be temporary, for others it&rsquo;s a life-changing condition. We&rsquo;re constantly looking for ways to prevent, treat and cure. Some people may be healed but ultimately the rest of us that are saved will have to wait until that last day to be gloriously transformed. Until then what can the Church do? In the same way that a pair of glasses or a hearing aid can help restore sight or hearing, how can the the Church assist in bringing people to Christ?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really pretty simple - <strong>don&rsquo;t get in the way.</strong></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true if a person has a disability or not, nothing we do should putting up barriers that stop people reaching the gospel.</p>

         	<blockquote>A peculiar people - 1 Peter 2:9 (KJV)</blockquote>

<p>When you stop and think about it, the (big C) Church is a really odd place, full of peculiar people. Just take a look around you and tell me if I'm wrong?!</p>

<p>To the outside world, our customs, our order of service is completely alien. We live in a "post-Christian" world, where even here in Northern Ireland there are many people who have never stepped foot in a Christian church, even if only for a wedding, baptism, or funeral. </p>

<p>Many churches are now having to react and change tactics to reach a people that never had faithful parents or grandparents who sent them out to Sunday School or the Good News Club. They have no idea what we do or who we are. </p>

<p>If we get too comfortable with our own culture we can easily loose the empathy that we need to reach people who are different than us. Changing culture doesn't mean throwing out the gospel - just recognising that we can't reach everyone with the same tactics. The most common place we see that is on the mission fields around the world, but in some ways even that has become familiar. It's almost as though those big, grand acts of service have somehow become easier than small gestures of love. Is it really easier to tithe than showing empathy for people who don't look like, or act like us?</p>

<p>As a parent of a child with special needs appropriate I can confidently say, appropriate church behaviour went out the window a long time ago and Lila and I are both so thankful for the leadership team and congregation at Grace Community Church for making us feel so welcome; from the very first day!</p>

<p>You might be thinking:<br />> "Warmly Welcoming new people to church? That doesn't sound revolutionary!"<br />You'd be right, but for parent like us who have a child with special needs, or another learning difficulty or disability, that's not something we can take for granted!</p>

<p>We have family and friends that support us, but that doesn't mean they don't don't struggle to understand our needs and our patterns as a family. Sometimes a big gesture can have disastrous affects or friends get upset and confused when you have to cancel events because you haven't had a sold night's sleep in 3 weeks or you know that their house isn't prepared for a curious and energetic 4 year old who likes to disassemble everything.</p>

<p>When struggles or difficulties are hidden, even actions offered in love may not be appropriate and when it comes to the fulfilling the great commission of going into all the world and preaching the gospel we must do so in the light of the great commandments:</p>

<p>> Matthew 22:37-39<br />> And he said to him, ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</p>

<p>For the church to reach sinners, regardless of their socio-economic background, ethnicity or level of ability it must adapt its ministry, but it must never forget about love. </p>

<p>- How can we be inclusive as a church?<br />- How can we make the gospel accessible?<br />- How can we share with others without it being an afterthought?</p>

<p>As a father I ask myself these same questions and as a parent of a child with autism I say "how on earth can I do that?" Especially when, at times, it feels like my life is being held together by nothing but duct tape and prayer! </p>

<p>If I struggle with that balance, what hope is there for family and friends? What hope is there for the Church? The only way to adapt is to know needs of the people we're working with and have empathy for them.</p>

<p>Our son's behaviour, the way he lost the words he once knew and struggled to communicate with us, or maintain eye contact and the fact that he would rarely give hugs or kisses didn't mean that he had nothing to say. I remember very clearly how he used to climb up beside us on the sofa and while sitting there would tap gently on your arm 3 times. It took us a little while to realise what he was doing but then we realised, this was Petey saying "I love you." </p>

<p>Petey couldn't express how he felt in the same way as us, but he found his own way, he adapted and in turn so did we, but in order to do that we had to learn to "listen" to him.</p>

         	<p><p>A few thoughts on the new Apple TV</p>  <ul> <li>The interface is very fast, the ‚Äúparallax wiggle‚Äù on icons seems like a gimic, but is actually a really useful way to locate your position on screen.</li> <li>The remote looks more breakable in screenshots than it actually is. <del>Thankfully it is pretty light and the trackpad does not have a glass top. If you have kids, you‚Äôll understand this one. </del>Turns out it actually is <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/11/01/psa-the-new-apple-tv-remote-might-shatter-if-you-drop-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breakable</a>¬†but you can still use the old remote to some extent.</li> <li>The remote although faster to use than the old model is a change in paradigm that may confuse some users, initially. Or maybe it was just me continually holding it upside down.</li> <li>The app store is pretty spartan, but there are good apps in there, unfortunately discoverability seems to be a bigger problem than on iOS.</li> <li>MFI controllers work in the system menus, which is a nice touch</li> <li>If you have a USB-C to USB-A cable you can install additional apps from GitHub, like <a href="https://github.com/jasarien/Provenance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Provenance</a> (a multi system emulator) and <a href="https://github.com/Auntie-Player/apple-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Auntie Player</a> (Unofficial BBC iPlayer)</li> <li>Speaking of the Beeb, I know they say an iPlayer app is coming, but when consider the absence of all UK catchup streaming services I have to wonder if Apple could not have been a little more selective with who got the devkits.</li> <li>All the pre-installed apps from the previous model (Crunchy Roll anyone?) are available as downloads. That‚Äôll save some clutter, thank goodness.</li> <li>No Podcasts app</li> <li>But Apple Music is finally here, to that‚Äôs good.</li> <li>But without Siri support <em>sigh</em></li> <li>And there‚Äôs no support from the iOS or WatchOS Remote apps, expect updates soon I guess</li> <li>Simplex is a great termporary(?) replacement for Plex</li> <li>You can use Siri Remote like a Wii Controller which is fun and reminds me that the Apple Store is selling wrist straps that connect to the lightning port. Yes, serioulsy.</li> <li>There are a number of less-than-obvious controls/shortcuts on the remote that help when inputting text, such as pressing the Play/Pause button to change case, in addition those found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT205305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You can also double click the display button to show the app switcher and quit apps with an upward swipe.</li> </ul></p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Alongside the release of their new tabletop game, Warhammer Age of Sigmar, <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop</a> have been promoting several new type of eBooks from their publishing imprint Black Library. For a company who already sell three distinct versions of their books, what does this mean, what is this ‚Äúnew‚Äù format and what does it mean for gamers?</p>  <p>First let‚Äôs look at the books we‚Äôve seen to date, they fall into 3 categories, Print, Enhanced (iBook) and eBook (EPUB 3 and Kindle).</p>  <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10361" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_0498-16-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_0498-16" width="990" height="743" /></p>  <h2><b>Print¬†</b></h2>  <p><a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/codicies-35.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignleft wp-image-10365 size-medium" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/codicies-35-208x300.jpg" alt="codicies-35" width="208" height="300" /></a>The print edition is exactly what you expect, the same hardcover format that we‚Äôve known for years, or is it? Around the end of 6th edition and release of 7th edition 40K there was a shift in the design of the BRB and the Codexes. Compare the text heavy Codexes of 2nd edition to the new Codex Space Marines and you‚Äôll see what I mean. The newer books are full of high quality, full page images, spacious type and high-res photography with a consistent styling between digital and print versions.</p>  <p>It seems as though the print version is now being designed alongside the digital editions, rather than being tacked on as an afterthought and shows that Games Workshop is serious about digital content. Perhaps they are even taking a ‚Äúdigital first‚Äù approach, it‚Äôs certainly possible as the print books now look a lot like the iBooks edition, but is more likely that they have well defined templates for both.</p>  <h3><i></i><em><b>Digital First Design</b></em></h3>  <p><em>A quick note on Digital First Design. Generally considered a good thing, there‚Äôs no denying that it can lead to a fresher, more modern looking book. That said, we‚Äôre starting to see publishing industry push-back, especially in education, as there is a definite feeling of sameness, even blandness to a lot of digital books that then migrates to print. eBooks are more or less packaged web pages, so some upcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com">CSS standards</a> should improve typography and layout options, allowing for much richer ‚Äúprint-like‚Äù designs in the future.</em></p>  <p><img class="wp-image-10366 size-full" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/f354ba1646.jpg" alt="fig02-19" width="400" height="326" /></p>  <h2><b>The problem with eReaders</b></h2>  <p><img class="wp-image-10369 size-medium alignright" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-19.05.24-24-215x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 19.05.24-24" width="215" height="300" />Not all ebooks and certainly not all eReaders are created equal. In the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù we can classify books as hardback, softback, comic books, coffee table, reference and so on. Here in the Matrix they‚Äôre all just ‚ÄúeBooks‚Äù and all formats are expected to work everywhere; this leads to Lowest Common Denominator Design.</p>  <p>The latest James Patterson novel is ideal to read on your Kindle or Nook, but for anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to navigate Warhammer 40,000: The Rules on a Kindle Paperwhite mid game will find it to be¬†a lesson in madness.</p>  <p><img class=" wp-image-10371 size-medium alignleft" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-19.08.33-27-214x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 19.08.33-27" width="214" height="300" />The layout is perfectly nice but this type of reader isn‚Äôt really designed for this type of content, it‚Äôs designed for novels. So instead we chop up our beautifully designed to make it linear. It‚Äôs like printing out the content of the rulebook on copy paper. I‚Äôm sure some people like it this way or have low expectations for the technology, maybe they just want an easy way to read the fluff, but for gaming it‚Äôs a horrible experience all-round. Why? Because any digital book creates an inherently poorer User Experience that the physical equivalent. We ‚Äúknow‚Äù how to use a book and use it quickly, in a non-linear fashion, as we jump from reference to reference. But this isn‚Äôt how a typical eReader works, as it‚Äôs primarily designed for novels, anything beyond linear navigation is a feature that‚Äôs been bolted-on.</p>  <p>This is a huge problem in Education as textbooks are also used in non-linear ways. eBooks that were initially seen as the way of the future, are now considered to cause more problems than the paper books they aimed to replace. This left room for companies like Apple and Inkling to come up with alternatives.</p>  <h2><b>Enhanced (iBooks)</b></h2>  <p>The most popular form of alternative eBook is the iBook working hand-in-hand with the iBooks application on Mac and iOS. The iBook format is a proprietary extension of EPUB 3 introducing some functionality unique to Apple WebKit and addressing the issues above by allowing richer designs and providing a more appropriate reading experience.</p>  <p><img class="wp-image-10379 size-large" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-21.58.04-47-1024x857.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 21.58.04-47" width="990" height="829" /></p>  <p>As with Digital First Design this was at first considered¬†a good thing.</p>  <p>Introduced by <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> at an education-focused event in 2012 the iBook was designed to solve the problem of creating digital textbooks. It allows anyone to create beautiful content specifically for Apple devices by using a WYSWIG editor and embedding interactive widgets like quizzes and galleries and an interactive glossary. The big improvement over standard EPUB 3 was the custom reader that Apple included in the iBooks Application (yes the format and reader are called the same thing. Yes there was also a laptop by the same name too) which provided a more natural method of navigation that your standard eReader. Using gestures you can swipe between Chapters, Sections and Pages and pan and zoom in and out to jump around in content.</p>  <p>Games Workshop started publishing books in this format back in 2012 and it finally seemed that a perfect format had been discovered for digital gaming books. If nothing else it certainly felt premium, further cemented by the release of Codex Space Marines which included enhanced features like embedded audio and the Force Requisition army builder.</p>  <p>It was around this point that I switched from print to digital, but as good as the iBooks format is, it does have issues. First off it‚Äôs iOS only and until very recently was iPad and Mac only. Secondly it‚Äôs slow. So slow. Apple added animated book opening effects to the iBooks software meaning that jumping from one section of a book to another (without a hyperlink) can take up to 10 seconds; in the heat of a game, that is way too long.</p>  <p>[caption id="attachment_10367" align="aligncenter" width="990"]<a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jul-14-2015-1819-21.gif"><img class="wp-image-10367 size-large" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Jul-14-2015-1819-21-1024x749.gif" alt="iBooks loading" width="990" height="724" /></a> This is a real-time animated gif of an iBook opening on a 2014 MacBook Pro.[/caption]</p>  <p><i></i>There are problems for <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apple-is-sabotaging-an-open-standard-for-digital-books/">publishers too</a>, the books can only be built using Apple‚Äôs proprietary iBooks Author tool, effectively introducing an additional development track to the publishing workflow and only sold through iBooks, for which Apple take a 30% royalty. This is why publishers like Amazon and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/26/5656468/comixology-ios-update-removes-in-app-purchases">Comixology have removed all buying functionality</a> from their apps, you can buy books from their online store and then download it to your device afterwards. It‚Äôs not a great experience for users but I can see why they do it, 30% is a huge junk wether you‚Äôre an indy publisher or a multinational.</p>  <p>I believe it‚Äôs been the dual pressures of providing high quality ebooks for non iOS users and a way to reduce the Apple tax on sales that has likely driven the creation of the new format released alongside Age of Sigmar.</p>  <h2><b>eBook edition</b></h2>  <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10377" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-19.43.58-44-234x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 19.43.58-44" width="234" height="300" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10376" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-19.43.48-40-234x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 19.43.48-40" width="234" height="300" /><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10375" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-19.43.38-41-233x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 19.43.38-41" width="233" height="300" />The ebook formats, <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-overview.html">EPUB 3</a> and <a href="http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/MOBI">Mobi</a>, get a bad wrap. If you‚Äôve seen the¬†digital version of White Dwarf magazine you‚Äôll know why. This is the same format that publishers use for novels, which obviously works well there, but makes it impossible to create more than the simplest of layouts. Known as ‚Äúreflowable ebooks‚Äù this content will ‚Äúflow‚Äù from screen to screen allowing you to change the font to suit and making it readable on any size of device.</p>  <p>Reflowable EPUBs can be created easily in many word processing packages and desktop publishing tools like Pages and InDesign or generated from a folder of text files. Content is king which is why the focus is put on type in this format, but compared to the the print or enhanced edition it looks like something your Nan could do in Microsoft Word.</p>  <p>What it does have going for it is that it is quick to produce and can run on pretty much every device. If you‚Äôve bought the DRM free ebooks from Black Library, you‚Äôll get a Kindle edition too (most publishers generate their Kindle books from the EPUB 3, which is why I didn‚Äôt include it on the list of formats.) Publishing through Black Library also allows Games Workshop to save the 30% that Apple takes on fees. Some may ask why GW don‚Äôt charge 30% more for books sold through iBooks and I‚Äôm sure they would if they can but Apple‚Äôs T&Cs stop you from charging a higher price for the same product on their store. On of the disadvantages of the Black Library is that for less technical users it can be pain to download and transfer ebooks; the Kindle is so successful due to the tight integration of eReader and store.</p>  <h2><b>New eBooks</b></h2>  <p>Two weeks ago my article would have stopped with the eBook edition, however Warhammer Age of Sigmar brought along a new flavour of eBook; no longer would Android or mobile<em> users have to suffer the poorly laid eBooks we‚Äôve seen in the past.</p>  <p></em><i>The recent iOS 8.4 update means the iBooks editions work on iPhone, so there‚Äôs no reason for iOS users to buy multiple formats.</i></p>  <p>The first of the new books was the Age of Sigmar paining guide, you can and should grab a sample of this on the Black Library site and in iBooks, it looks lovely. Or should I say <i>they</i> look lovely because the tablet and mobile versions have appropriately different designs and using an app like Calibre or Kindle Previewer you can freely and legally convert them to work on your Kindle too.</p>  <p><img class=" wp-image-10382 alignnone aligncenter" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.36.40-51-167x300.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 22.36.40-51" width="280" height="502" /><img class=" wp-image-10383 alignnone aligncenter" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.36.48-52-784x1024.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 22.36.48-52" width="500" height="653" /></p>  <p>Like the standard eBooks, these are also EPUB 3 but used the fixed-layout flag in their config, this let‚Äôs publishers set a page size in pixels and layout the content exactly as they want it to show. Beautiful looking eBooks and on mobile too, have we just found the holy grail?</p>  <p>No actually. The fixed layout format has fallen slightly out of favour with publishers for a number of reasons, the biggest of these is that eReaders treat this type of content like a PDF in a few ways.</p>  <ul>     <li>Font size: In fixed layout books you (obviously) can‚Äôt change font size, so you‚Äôre at the mercy of the designers, just like a PDF. You can zoom in and pan around though so at least that‚Äôs something.</li>     <li>Annotations: If you want to make notes and scribbles in your eBook you‚Äôre out of luck beyond the most basic text, unless of course the eReader allows for something more. Compare that to the numerous PDF apps out there on desktop, tablet and mobile that let you markup the page however you see fit.</li>     <li>Page size: The name ‚Äúfixed layout" says it all, the page size is set to common iOS screen ratios. On older iPhones and Android you‚Äôll likely find some some borders around the content.</li>     <li>Treated like a PDF: If you compare a fixed layout page and a properly generated (with links and stuff) PDF you‚Äôd be hard pressed to see the difference. Open one of these books in iBooks and you‚Äôll even see the same UI used to navigate PDFs with the added problem of performance issues</li> </ul>  <p><i>As each page in a fixed layout eBook is a single HTML (XHTML actually) page, iBooks uses the webkit rendering engine to process each page and generate a thumbnail, letting you scrub through pages quickly. However iBooks doesn't really cope with scale, possibly because people didn‚Äôt consider the 250+ page behemoths that we see in gaming and in education. Image trying to open 250 graphics heavy web pages at the same time, that‚Äôs what opening a large fixed layout book is like. Thankfully once it‚Äôs finished processing the book works great but on older devices like the iPad 2 or original iPad Mini you might find that iBooks crashes each time you try as it comes up against the memory limit on the device.</i></p>  <p>There‚Äôs nothing wrong with fixed layout EPUB 3 per se, it‚Äôs just that the eReaders let us down again; the portable reading experience is very different from the printed and should treated as such in both the design of the books and the eReaders used to consume them. So what is this format good for? In my line of work we use it a lot of kids‚Äô story books and direct conversions of legacy books when stakeholders require a 1:1 match between print and digital; it‚Äôs generally <a href="http://www.albertopettarin.it/blog/2015/02/21/current-fixed-layout-ebooks-considered-harmful.html">considered as something of a step-backward</a> in this case.</p>  <p>Unlike the iBooks (enhanced) editions the new fixed layout EPUB‚Äôs don‚Äôt require a separate development track, they‚Äôve been generated from InDesign automatically, you can see this in the metadata section of the image below. For template driven content like this, once you‚Äôve got a your first project set up, there is little to no additional work to generate fixed layout content for new books. Beyond clicking the export button that is.</p>  <p><a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.48.34-56.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10385" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.48.34-56-1024x257.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 22.48.34-56" width="990" height="248" /></a></p>  <p>So think about this, Games Workshop now makes a book once and can now export automatically to print, mobile, tablet and probably even ebook editions but instead of users buying a book and getting access to whatever format is necessary, users are encouraged to buy the same book multiple times generating almost pure profit for</p>  <p>I‚Äôve said before that I have no problem paying the same for a digital book as the print edition, but this only applies to ‚Äúprestige‚Äù formats like iBook edition, or Comics on Comixology, where care has been taken in the design and implementation to provide a better experience, e.g.. the special features added to the latest Codexes. Like many of you I‚Äôll even go as far as to buy the print and digital editions of some books and the Horus Heresy series from Forge World is the type of book you‚Äôd only ever want in physical form but I have to draw a line at paying twice for what is the same thing.</p>  <p>There is no technical reason that the mobile, tablet and ebook editions shouldn‚Äôt all count as the same purchase, there‚Äôs even an argument that they should be available as a download with every print book or perhaps even charge a small premium like Marvel do with comics. I can‚Äôt help but think the iOS 8.4 update came at a bad time for GW, you‚Äôd think that with the number of iPhones in the market they wouldn't miss out on telling people that their books now work on iPhone too. Unless of course they want mobile users to buy another copy. (Of course they do.)</p>  <p>For my money I‚Äôll continue to buy the iBook (enhanced) editions, the app may be slow, but it‚Äôs improving and as eReader designed for education its support for annotations and glossaries is second to none. The fact that I can now get these books on my iPhone only helps seal the deal. If I ever move to Android, yes that means I‚Äôd loose access to my books, but as it stands now I‚Äôd need to pay twice to have the appropriate book on both my Android tablet and mobile.</p>  <h3><b>A Note on eBooks</b></h3>  <p>As someone who makes eBooks for a living, this might sound like I‚Äôm shooting myself in the foot, but be careful when buying eBooks, not only are you subject to lock-in in various book stores, but the terms and conditions from some publishers may mean that you never own the content and trying to convert from one format to another may mean you are actually in breach of their terms.</p>  <p><a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.55.23-59.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10387" src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-14-22.55.23-59-1024x546.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-14 22.55.23-59" width="990" height="528" /></a></p>  <p>Always look for DRM free options where possible never be afraid to push back on publishers to improve the quality of their ebooks. You wouldn't stand for a brand new printed Codex if the cover was hanging off and the ink smudged on a bunch of pages, digital products should be no different.</p>

         	<p>*TLDR: Or at least a rough estimate of how long you've spent on a project.</p>  <p>It's very easy, even for the most disciplined of teams, to become so involved in a project that agile stories and time trackers go out the window; the only goal is to finish. We had this happen on a project last year and it made it very hard to see where the time went¬†during our project retrospective. We knew we'd been working constantly, but on what? Knowing that we did diligently commit our code to Git made me wonder if there was a way to approximate time spent based on commit timestamps.</p>  <p>Turns out, several people had already been working on this and we settled on a ruby gem from¬†<a href="https://rietta.com/blog/2012/05/06/new-git-time-extractor-gem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Rietta</a>. You can read more about the assumptions used in calculations over at his site and <a href="https://github.com/rietta/git_time_extractor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, but it couldn't be easier to install:</p>  <p>Installing is easy from your computer with Ruby installed. From the command line, run: gem install git_time_extractor Then go one of your GIT project directories, and run: git_time_extractor &gt; output_time.csv</p>  <p>The reason I picked this tool over others is that the spreadsheet generated can be manipulated in whatever way need for records, sort by employee, what took the longest, how much time did we spend in total etc.</p>

         	<p>We have three published apps in each App Store, iTunes, Amazon App Store and Google Play, they‚Äôre published by our account but use licenced third-party IP. </p>  <p>We‚Äôve had two apps rejected on first pass by Apple only to be accepted at review when we proved we held the necessary licence, a third because of an issue with a demo account that we fixed and they re-reviewed the same day.</p>  <p>On Amazon an eBook reader app for a tabletop games company was rejected with no reason other than ‚ÄúAmazon deemed it unsuitable for Kindle‚Äù but was allowed on other Amazon devices; we eventually made it onto Kindle too after some tweaks. Just like Amazon removing IAP in Comixology and leaving it out of the Kindle App, we had to drop IAP in our ereader on Amazon.</p>  <p>On Google one app was actually pulled after being live for months, this is something not many people see or hear about.

Back in April one in particular caught my eye Pebble, by the aptly named <a href="http://getpebble.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble Technologies</a> took Kickstarter by storm raising ¬†$10 million (!!), well over their initial goal of $100K.</p>  <p>The Pebble uses¬†Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 to pair with your phone an receive notifications, paired with an e-ink display the drain on both watch and phone is very low, unlike last year's <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/accessories/smartwatch/specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony Xperia Smartwatch</a>.</p>  <p>Out of the box (and on iOS especially) the Pebble doesn't do much more than show the time and weather, but on Android (and ¬†iOS 7) it can be set up to receive custom notifications, receive navigation directions from Google maps, control music and more.</p>  <p>Honestly, it takes more work than most people would be bothered with, but I don't mind. I even took to creating my own watch face, combining the popular split-screen look with Calendar events.

Increased performance, high DPI (aka Retina) display support with scaling, improved battery life and more consistency between Desktop and Modern UI.

Support for Desktop/Modern is also a welcome improvement.<br /><br />Windows 8.1 aside, I came across two tweaks that have had a huge impact on usability, moving the recovery partition to a USB and reducing CPU performance on battery, have given me 7GB more disk space and up to 6 hours battery usage; moving the Surface Pro into (old) MacBook Air territory.<br /><br />Increase disk space:<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/storage-files-and-folders/create-a-recovery-drive?lc=2057">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/storage-files-and-folders/create-a-recovery-drive?lc=2057</a><br /><br />Improve battery life:<br /><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-battery-life-solution-found">http://www.examiner.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-battery-life-solution-found</a><br /><br />Despite my initial disgust I've even given the stylus a go and found it incredibly useful to annotate Word documents and make quick notes in Evernote.<br /><br />One week ago I ¬†thought the only use the Surface Pro would get would be the occasional UI test and fixing a wonky table leg, now I can almost see it being my everyday machine.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br /> </div>

         	<p><p><br />Tablet form factor is an interesting thing; an iPad user since day one, I sold my iPad 2 after using the Nexus 7 for a week last year, but once the iPad Mini was released I jumped at the chance to own an iOS device in the 7&rdquo; form factor. I am a Mac user, my primary phone is an iPhone, and regardless of how good the Nexus 7 is , the iPad fitted with my workflow, seamlessly. Setting the availability of certain apps aside (<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OmniFocus, OmniGraffle</a> are both Mac apps that are available on iPad too) I&rsquo;m not saying I can&rsquo;t use anything else, but at the moment, I don&rsquo;t want to, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I won&rsquo;t try.<br /><br />Through my day-job at <a href="http://purpleguerrilla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Purple Guerrilla</a> I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity lately to test on all of the major 10&rdquo; tablets. Despite going in with some pre-formed opionions about what I would and wouldn&rsquo;t like, I found the results quite surprising.<br /><br /></p>  <h3>Apple iPad</h3>  <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4R28eldAwhs/UcCC2FQZHkI/AAAAAAAAITk/EWCPuIwU_Tg/s1600/iPad_wRet_Pinch_Wht_Photo_PRINT.png"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/13f29e5461.jpg" width="320"></a>First up, the &ldquo;New&rdquo; iPad, not the newer iPad, commonly referred to as the iPad 4. The differences are minor enough that for the purposes of this test, I&rsquo;ll consider them as one and the same.<br /><br />The 10&rdquo; iPad is a beast. I remember when the first iPad was released, it was like something from sci-fi, the iPad 2 form factor slimmed this down further, but compared to an iPad Mini, it&rsquo;s still huge. If you don&rsquo;t have an iPad Mini you have to understand just how slim a device it is. I was watching actual, near future, sci-fi a few weeks back and an iPad Mini used as a prop, looked so futuristic that I found it jarring.<br /><br />There&rsquo;s something about the iPad&rsquo;s &ldquo;premium&rdquo; build quality and weight (slightly heavier than iPad 2) that make it feel very fragile; like handling your Granny&rsquo;s best china. Nexus devices get a bad rap for feeling cheap, but I have no qualms throwing one down on a coffee table; if I tried that with an iPad it would probably slide right off.<br /><br /></p>  <h3>Microsoft Surface Pro</h3>  <p>I really wanted this to be good, I genuinely mean that. I&rsquo;m so divorced from the Windows way of doing things (since I installed that first free Red Hat CD from PCW Magazine) that I actually like Windows 8 and its Modern UI. The problem is that despite all the marketing and posturing, the Surface Pro is not a tablet. The Surface RT is a pretty lack-lustre device, but at lease it is a tablet, the Pro, despite the name is a completley different device. The closest comparison that I can make is that this is Microsoft&rsquo;s MacBook Air, it&rsquo;s a fully featured, Intel based, ultra portable notebook.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l2_VvUMOatQ/UcCC1_dbNcI/AAAAAAAAITo/VtYfZwtS6kg/s1600/01-22SurfacePen_Web.png"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/d489a676b9.jpg" width="320"></a><br />The problem&rsquo;s started when I was first handed the device. The Surface Pro is so heavy that you wonder what they&rsquo;ve filled the device with. (This article is not about facts and figures, but about experiences and sensations; the things that actually matter when using these devices.) I know from The Verge&rsquo;s excellent review that the Pro is half a pound heavier, that makes this 10&rdquo; &ldquo;screen&rdquo; it heavier than my 15&rdquo; Macbook Pro.<br /><br />Too heavy to use as a tablet and with an active battery life of no more than 4 hours, it seems that the Surface Pro is designed to be used at a desk. The inclusion of a Display Port for video out only reinforces this, as does the inability to charge via USB (like every other tablet), both Surface models require a reasonably large power brick. Whilst chained to my desk via power cord I noticed another problem, the Surface Pro comes with a stylus which clips limply into the side of the device, using the same magentic port that is used for the power adapter. So, that&rsquo;s going to get lost soon.<br /><br />As metioned previously the Modern UI really appeals to me, so nothing is more frustrating that launching an app and being kicked straight into &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; or Desktop mode <em>cough</em> Office <em>cough</em>. I wish there was a more clear division, even a switch to disable the traditional Desktop and the apps that require it, however it seems most long-time users have more of an issue with Modern UI and want to kill it and reclaim their Start button.<br /><br />Microsfoft like to compare their devices against those from Apple, recent ads have shown off the Surface&rsquo;s true HD (1080p) display and 64GB storage as standard, so it was a little surprising to find that roughly 40GB of that storage are taken up by Windows 8 itself. 40GB, just think about that for a moment. Imagine buying a 16GB iPad to find you have only 6GB of usable space, people are already outraged by the 1GB or so that they currently loose to iOS,<br /><br />The Surface Pro could be a successful device, if I was working in a Windows environment, I&rsquo;d certainly take it over a Lenovo Thinkpad, but as a tablet it would be easy to carry around one made of stone. It&rsquo;s also¬†prohibitively¬†expense, ¬£719 without the essential keyboard/cover.<br /><br />As some people will think that there was no chance I&rsquo;d find any redeeming qualities in the Surface, I made this list of things that I do like.<br /><br /></p>  <ul> <li>Windows 8 - Modern UI</li> <li>Touch Cover</li> <li>The trackpad on the Touch Cover</li> <li>The premium build quality</li> <li>I actually like the little flap!</li> <li>Internet Explorer 10</li> <li>Accounts sync across Windows 8 devices via my Windows Live ID</li> <li>The Pro runs desktop games pretty well; there&rsquo;s something cool about being able to plug my Xbox controller in and have it work automatically.</li> </ul>  <p><br /></p>  <h3>Google Nexus 10</h3>  <p>I know it&rsquo;s been out a while, but the Nexus 10 (or any 10&rdquo; Android) was never really on my radar. Thinner and lighter than the iPad and with the a 300dpi display, the Nexus 10, despite being made by Samsung (I generally find Samsung devices to be plasticky) is easily the best Android tablet I&rsquo;ve used to date.<br /><br /></p>  <div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UlTkghDZwpc/UcCC19nfQ9I/AAAAAAAAITs/4paBmJdAYaQ/s1600/Nexus10_Tabled.png"><img border="0" height="164" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/e1c635c510.jpg" width="640"></a></div>  <p><br />Android Jellybean 4.2.2 is not all that different from I last remember it, it&rsquo;s an incremental release, but one that makes the OS feel a little more coherent. For example calendar events from my Exchange account show in Google Now, previously Exchange email and calendars were left out in the cold; I guess Google thought no one in business would use a Google device. The &ldquo;holo&rdquo; interface, introduced in 4.0, brings coherency to what was a very fragmented UI (similar to what iOS 7 will hopefully do for Apple), Android looks futuristic, but is still very useable; not an easy feat to manage.<br /><br />The device itself is strange, while the iPad is very uniform, the Surface solid (like the 2001 Monolith) the Nexus 10 is a bit &ldquo;wobbly&rdquo;. With rounded corners and a asymmetric thickness, the Nexus 10 looks soft and friendly. It&rsquo;s also remarkably easy to hold in one hand, like a book. Something which I find painful with a large iPad and impossible with a Surface Pro. Sideloading of content to Google Books, extended Google Drive functionality, better Exchange support and a beautiful 300DPI display have made the Nexus 10 a real joy to use and I&rsquo;ve found myself reaching for it over any other device<br /><br />The one thing (literally the <i>one</i>¬†thing) that lets the Nexus down is the fragmented Android development environment. When Apple released it&rsquo;s retina devices, with much fanfare, it provided the tools and incentive to developers to make their apps retina ready. Whilst almost all (citation needed) new iOS apps are built with retina support and pixel doubled graphics, most apps on Android that operate without the &ldquo;Holo&rdquo; UI have yet to be updated. The worst offender, <a href="http://www.comixology.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comixology</a>, who already have HD comics on iPad but on the Nexus with an even higher dpi count, we&rsquo;re still looking at the low-res version. Digital comics may not interest you at all, but the principle is this, that the world leader in this vein of digital media, 5 months after launch, has not updated their app to support the Nexus 10&rsquo;s screen. My suspicion (based on limited Android development) is that the problem is not with Comixology, but with the Android SDK and the¬†difficulty¬†inherent with developing apps at multiple screen densities, for countless variations of device.<br /><br /></p>  <h3>Result</h3>  <div>I think it&rsquo;s clear, despite living and working in a predominately Apple ecosystem, my choice of 10&rdquo; tablet is unquestionably the Nexus 10. That said, if my very sizeable¬†man-bag¬†caught fire and I could only save one device, it would still be the iPad Mini, because that&rsquo;s what &ldquo;works&rdquo; for me.¬†</div>  <div><br /></div>  <div>The best advice I can give you, is don&rsquo;t listen to the fanbois, adverts or¬†anyone working for PC World and¬†find the device that works for you, not the other way round.</div>  <div><br /></div>  <div><span>Update: The Kindle Fire HD was to be on this list but had to be returned. Unable to be registered, it turned out there had been a mixup in the depot and this was not my Kindle Fire and the intended recipient had marked the device as stolen!</span></div>  <div><span><br /></span></div>  <div><span>Update 2: I had to stop myself returning to the Surface Pro section after recalling a series of other issues. It&rsquo;s safe to say, it&rsquo;s not a tablet!</span></div></p>

This was a side of Apple that we rarely see; aware of its criticism and the ecosystem in which it exists. I don't see Steve Jobs doing that, but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing either.<br /><br />I've had around 24 hours to review and play with iOS 7, although my initial reaction was akin to a religious experience, the lustre quickly wore off when testing on a phone filled with third party apps. Much like the Microsoft Surface ads, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/includes/videos/features.html#video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS 7 video</a> had lots of shots of Apple's own apps (and Jony Ive in a white room), but back in the real world, what were once beautifully designed third party apps, now look heavy and out of place; an artifical barrier¬†now¬†wedged between the old and new design paradigms.<br /><br />I love the new design language, unlike <a href="http://www.theverge.com/apple/2013/6/10/4416726/the-design-of-ios-7-simply-confusing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> I don't mind the icons and I can accept that this is a beta, but I have to wonder how this will affect app development.These days the best Android apps use the &quot;holo&quot; design language, the same with Modern UI on Windows 8. iOS, on the other had, has a history of strong third party UIs, so it will be interesting to see how developers take to, or even adapt the new interface.<br /><br />Parting thought: OS X Mavericks - Calendar and Maps seem to conform to the new design guidelines, should we expect a complete overhaul by the time it is released?</p>

         	<p><br /></p>  <div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-90kPLVokpmc/UBJsOFId0PI/AAAAAAAADLQ/GlM5dqToFXk/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-07-26+at+21.24.08.png"><img border="0" height="263" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/23ea619636.jpg" width="320"></a></div>  <div>Sometimes you come across a simple app that actually makes a big difference; Sidekick by Oomph is one such app for OS X.<br /><br />Sidekick uses Location Services, network names and connected devices to change wallpaper, connect servers, adjust brightness or volume and a dozen or more other features. Alternatively profiles can be switched manually, but it still give you a lot more power than the Location option in the Networking preference pane.<br /><br />For someone like me who has always used their personal computer in work, this makes a huge difference. The last thing you want to see when you kick back is that half finished design or email, because the next thing you know it's 11pm and you're still working.<br /><br />Sidekick opens and closes applications when you enter or leave a location. For me that means work apps, Sublime Text 2, Tower, Espresso, Google App Engine all quit when I leave NISP, when I arrive home my volume increases, my wallpaper changes and when I connect to ethernet (only at home) my wifi is switched off and a Time Machine backup is kicked off.<br /><br />You can spend hours configuring locations to fire various events, based on advanced methods of detection, but in an easy and intuitive way. Also, although not a bug with Sidekick itself, the more complicated you make the settings to switch a profile, the more likely you are to have something go wrong. I initially set Sidekick to quit those apps above when I left the NI Science Park, but what if I want to work from The Dock cafe (<a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/"><a href="http://www.thedockchurch.org/">http://www.thedockchurch.org/</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>)? As soon as Sidekick detected I had left my office wifi it decided I must be at home. This is where Oomph's approach to location detection really works, I could either add The Dock's wifi to my work profile or extend the area that counted as &quot;work&quot;.<br /><br />Two days in and no more than 10 minutes spend configuring and I think I've covered all the bases. Now that my MacBook can separate Work and Home life, all I need is a version of Sidekick for my brain.<br /><br />Sidekick is available at¬†<a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/"><a href="http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/">http://oomphalot.com/sidekick/</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>¬†for only $29</div>  <p><span role="button"><br /></span></p>

During construction, his plans for additional life boats and extra safety features were overruled, resulting (or at least contributing greatly) to the loss of life and sinking of the ship on it‚Äôs maiden voyage on 14th April 2012.</span><br /><br /><span>Sadly Thomas Andrews died onboard Titanic when it sank. A telegraph after the tragedy reads ‚Äú‚Ä¶ALL UNANIMOUS THAT ANDREWS HEROIC UNTO DEATH, THINKING ONLY SAFETY OTHERS‚Ä¶‚Äù What a legacy to leave behind; despite his warnings being ignored and the ship sinking fast, Andrews still thought of the passengers (users) first.</span><br /><br /><span>So how do we build ‚Äúunsinkable software‚Äù? We can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs impossible, but we can try. Even if we don‚Äôt convince clients to do the right thing, then we should still do everything we can to help the user. Our code/designs will be the better for it and people will take notice.</span><br /><span><br /></span><br /><span><br /></span></p>

         	<p>A few weeks ago on twitter I passed remark to <a href="http://twitter.com/cimota">Matt Johnston</a> that it would be great to have Industry-funded, STEM-focused schools in Northern Ireland. Yesterday, Matt put me in touch with ¬†<a href="http://twitter.com/denisstewart">Denis Stewart</a> and his wife, who between them have more experience of the education system than everyone I know, combined.<br /><br />In the IT industry we love to rail on the &quot;failings&quot; of the education system and think if only we had the chance we could do it better. There are so many factors involved in changing education that it become much more than just changing education; cultural factors, family pressures, financial implications and job vacancies all have to be taken into consideration. There are already schools in NI, who receive funding from Industry and who have specialities in a range of STEM subjects, who I have no doubt are very good at what they do. Innovation is contagious; I'm sure many of these schools developed their speciality from one teacher, passionate about their subject who drove school policy forward.<br /><br />I don't pretend I can fix things or that I have all (if any) answers. My school has been very good in giving me free reign, setting IT policy and testing out new systems, but we're part of a very small sub-group of a much larger system and as someone put it yesterday in &quot;the Tasmania of Northern Ireland.&quot;<br /><br />Is it enough to have a few specialist schools and a few innovative teachers? What about those who are still unreached? Mostly working class boys, whose career aspirations are either professional footballer, reality TV star, claim benefits, or &quot;get out of school at 16, join a trade and make some money.&quot; I'm not being elitist; if I'm honest this is my cultural background. Neither am I saying everyone should go down an academic route. What I ask is, how many of these students would be potential innovators, if we could only get them past, &quot;maths is hard&quot; and &quot;science is boring.&quot; How can we show what will be out there in ten years time when to them school is so irrelevant; they have more technology in their bedroom than most classrooms and they make better use of it too.<br /><br />How can we better connect technology? Not just connect different elements of technology but how can we connect with teachers and students and get them engaged with it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> was one of those moments when society became truly engaged with the Internet; I knew it had made a difference when my 70 year old Aunt began using a Napster clone to download knitting patterns. ¬†Education needs it's Napster. Not a way to illegally download music in class, but a way to connect existing technologies; meeting a need which it's users may not even realise they have.<br /><br />Whether it's debating the need for STEM schools/STEM in schools, developing Jotter or teaching, I want to make the best of technology that exists, which we may even have, but aren't using in a useful way. Aspiring that my software project, Jotter be like Napster is perhaps a very lofty ambition; but is it not better to set a high goal and fall short, achieving something, than not set any goal or try at all. Is that not what we keep advising our students and if it isn't, why on earth not?<br /><br /></p>

         	<p>My move from developing software to teaching high school was extremely enlightening; working and socialising with a tech savvy crowd had made me ignorant to how IT was perceived by users in the &quot;real world.&quot;<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />After watching <a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/">Objectified</a> I began to think about how you don't need to know about all of your users to make a good product, just the extremes; the middle will fall into place by itself.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />On one end there are some really switched-on people in education, <a href="http://twitter.com/fraserspeirs">Fraser Speirs</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/digmo">David Cleland</a>, to name but two, who are pioneering the use of technology in schools. ¬†At the other, you have teachers who have don't have an internet at home or know how to use The Google and who reluctantly go along with new IT policies that come across their desk, they'll need help, but have no other choice. To them IT is an unnecessary inconvenience. In the middle you have teachers who are IT aware, they can send emails, use a printer and probably have a Facebook account, but it's a means to an end. As long as things work they're happy to make use of it.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />As software is developed, we not only need to ensure it is relevant, functional and well designed, but that it is usable even by those who have very little IT experience; there's no age barrier either, graduates can have worse IT skills than veteran teachers; none of them will be installing Moodle. Users in the middle might not spend time online searching for a new piece of software (although now that &quot;apps&quot; are such an embedded part of culture, perhaps I'm wrong) but if what they use works, in that it works how they work, then the software itself will melt away.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />As I see it, a huge problem with how ICT is used in education is that is still isn't seen as an infrastructure, like the building or the electricity. We get a pile of computers and throw them into a classroom and tell the teacher to work away. In Northern Ireland, C2K has made huge leaps forward, but there are still too few teachers who are happy, willing and/or skilled enough to innovate with the resources they've been given.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />The <a href="http://apple.com/ipad">iPad</a>, solution or not, is seen as the &quot;microwave&quot; of the computing world and, what many don't realise, is more cost effective than netbooks, which, my school at least, thought, would be good value for money. If you count up the cost of repairs, and reinstalls we could have bought an iPad and still had change. Its not the only way either, I have high hopes for Google's <a href="http://google.com/chromeos">Chrome OS</a>; I customised Ubuntu on our netbooks so that they don't even have a traditional GUI, only the browser and I've never looked back.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />While many in the IT industry (myself included) have called for the death of the traditional IT Teacher and instead have IT as an integral part of every subject, it isn't possible; not until hardware and software become invisible, just like an everyday appliance. I can only hope that <a href="http://jotterapp.com/">Jotter</a> will be invisible to its users.<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><br />As the project continues, I'll release more information about exactly what Jotter is. At the moment I'm still not sure how to describe it myself, but hopefully from these blog posts you'll at least see the reasons behind what we are doing.<br /></p>  <p><br /><br /></p>  <p><br />Andrew Gribben<br /></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p></p>

         	<p>If there is one thing I won't tolerate in my class, it's sectarianism. Pupils who ordinarily show the utmost respect for teachers, can suddenly get riled up, treating you like a traitor, should you dare challenge them on what can only be described as a sin. It‚Äôs a touchy subject and the possibility of angry letters and phone calls from parents always seem a possibility, so it‚Äôs important to tread carefully and appropriately.<br /><br />Many humanists would have us believe that religion (of any sort) has been the cause of war and misery throughout time, they aren‚Äôt wrong. Christians shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúreligious‚Äù at least not in the way the Pharisees, of Jesus‚Äô, time were. We need to interpret everything we do and believe through the lens of scripture, as means of self diagnosis to see if what we are doing is right. However the pattern throughout history is of people claiming who outwardly claim faith but inwardly harbour sin which they use to twist and warp scripture to suit their purpose.<br /><br />Current day examples include ‚ÄúProtestant‚Äù paramilitaries, who don't know what the reformation was, or Christians who exclaim that immigrants should go back to their own countries and stop ‚Äústealing our homes and jobs.‚Äù Where‚Äôs their Christ-like nature; welcoming in strangers and those less fortunate?<br /><br />The Bible must be taken as whole, not select random passages, not taken out of context, not adapted to fit our agenda or mindset. Just because a sin is traditional or cultural in its basis doesn‚Äôt make it OK; tradition and culture are not bigger or more relevant than scripture itself. Christians, not just in Northern Ireland, need to actually apply the Bible to their whole lives, not just choose parts of it as it suits.<br /><br />What are your thoughts?</p>

Look at what I've missed, Oil spill, Coalition Government, the Pope etc... ¬†So many ideas, notes and draft posts but never actually taking the time to do the research writing the post<br /><br />From here on out I'll only be posting about the things for which I have the time and/or passion to write about.<br /><h2>'Open School' project</h2> <br />The biggest reason I've been stuck in such a rut has been the 'Open School" project that I unwittingly started by thinking my life, staff life and pupil life would be so much easier if we just fired Ubuntu on the new computers in school. For all intents and purposes this is entirely true, but I've also been inspired to learn new skills and modify computers and networks to give users the best possible system.<br /><br />I blogged <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2010/02/ubuntu-in-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously</a> about the use of Ebox (now known as <a href="http://www.zentyal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zentyal</a>) as a server with <a href="http://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> desktops authenticating against an LDAP database. Apart from some authentication work involving Novell Netware, a few years back whilst working at UU, this has all been completely new to me.<br /><br />Over the summer I began the process of configuring a desktop using Ubuntu 10.04, which went as follows:<br /><ul> <br /><li>Locking down configuration options</li> <br /><li>Enabling remote desktop via gconf</li> <br /><li>Mounting home directories from the server</li> <br /><li>Running scripts on login,</li> <br /><li>Syncing with Dropbox</li> <br /><li>Creating menu entries for class content</li> <br /><li>Using netlogon to tell Windows to mount the samba Documents share as "My Documents"</li> <br /> </ul> <br />With everything working I started to draft a post explaining this process and the changes made to the server:<br /><ul> <br /><li>DHCP Server</li> <br /><li>Network gateway with content filtering</li> <br /><li>Setting filtering to allow internet access based on users in groups, and objects such as class and year.</li> <br /> </ul> <br />Finally (or so I thought) I installed <a href="https://wiki.edubuntu.org/SettingUpClonezillaDRBLonUbuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRBL and Clonezilla</a> on a spare machine, created images of the desktop and server and deployed the desktop image to the other 22 machines.<br /><br />At this point those of you that interested in having a setup like this are asking me to tell you how. Unfortunately I am terrible at documenting as I go. Instead I've created a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/independentchristianschool.org/openschool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiki page for the 'Open School'</a> and will try to bring together all the links and information I have used to help me achieve this configuration, amending and adding my own content as necessary.<br /><h2>"So I thought"</h2> <br />Last weekend I deployed the clones of our server and desktop to our sister school in Portdown. Even though no two machines were a like, thanks to the flexibility of Ubuntu, the only changes I had to make were to the installed printer and the machines' hostnames.<br /><br />Our Bangor school has expressed a desire to use the same setup and at the end of October I'll be giving a presentation on the 'Open School' at a joint teacher training day, where staff from the other four schools will be in attendance. I intend to show the benefits and creative opportunities offered by a Linux based deployment and hope to be kept busy in the months to come, as other schools come on board.<br /><br />Next I'll be learning how to synchronise the LDAP trees between schools and configure offline LDAP authentication for our Ubuntu netbooks.<br /><br />I'm very grateful to my School and our School Board for giving me the freedom to develop this project, as well as learn new skills and keep those that I have, fresh. I'll try my best to keep the wiki updated, but if anyone else has suggestions or questions make sure to let me know!<br /><br /> </div>

I got a few very generous offers of machines which I hope to collect shortly. That said we still need more, so if you have some old tech lying around, gathering dust and bothering the wife, why not give it to us?</p>  <p><br />You're probably asking why you should give something to a school for free, school have lots of money! Not exactly, our school is a registered charity and receives no money from the government; every penny comes from fees, gifts and fund raising, so you really would be helping us out.<br /><br /><img title="communicate medium" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/d0dde0f1ad.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203"><br /><br />We're going to load up the machines with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook/features">Ubuntu Netbook Remix</a> so all pupils have a consistent and familiar platform to work on, now that we're running Ubuntu on all the school computers. We'll try and upgrade the RAM as much as possible in all the machines tom make them a little more useable and then just hand them out to Year 11 and 12 (GCSE) pupils to use in whatever way they wish. As well as the standard web and office apps, Ubuntu is packed with creative apps too and it'll be nice to see what they can produce and how they will fit a laptop into school life. Come September we hope to have all the laptops we need, it's a small school so we actually only need 10 computers to cover both year groups. There are only 23 pupils in the whole high school!<br /><br />If you'd like to donate a spare laptop, just leave a comment below, the form will take your email address, but not publish it. Alternatively if you have any questions or tips on 1:1 computing I'd love to hear from you.</p>

This morning I decided to introduce my Year 8-10 group to the work of <a href="http://feltron.com/">Nicholas Felton</a>, namely his annual reports. Although most thought he suffered from some sort of OCD, they did pick out useful and interesting facts and information about his life; how far he travels, where he eats most etc.<br /><br />None of them could see where this was going.<br /><br />Wowed by the beautiful info-graphics and under the threat of algebra worksheets I convinced the class that over the next two weeks we will keep track of where we go, what we eat and any social activities, at the end of which we will compile the information and create our own Feltron report. Using individual and combined data they will all get the chance to create graphs and charts, which will be put on display for the end of term Praise service.<br /><br />I have the added benefit of using Foursquare to check-in as I go; the kids however will be limited to a notepad and pen, although some of the more tech savvy plan to send text messages to themselves. All the information will be put into a spreadsheet on their Google docs account, with Google maps used to calculate distance travelled. Tomorrow we'll make a Google Docs form to help enter the data and start discussing the types of charts we can create to display the information.<br /><br />Although not pure maths or directly on the syllabus, this should help them develop a more real world understanding of what can be done with data and graphs as well as learn some useful IT skills along the way.<br /><br />Let me know what you think, or any suggestions on other information that could be gathered or things to do with it.</p>

It would seem that in just over a week the Ebook (or is it eBook?) reader has been relegated to a niche product and the LCD backlit iPad announced as the new saviour of books, newspapers and the rest of the publishing industry. Ironically the move that will save this industry is the exact same one that only a few years ago was¬†apparently going to¬†destroy the record industry. The iPad with it's shiny colourful <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ibooks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBooks</a> and funky page turn transitions is¬†apparently¬†the closest thing to a real book that you will get.<br /><br />Do you know what, they're probably right too, with the power of the Apple brand and the iPad hype, it's hard to see iBooks not being a success. Even setting aside the damage done to your retinas and the carpal tunnel from the weight of holding a 9&quot; &quot;book&quot; I really do feel that it's going to reintroduce reading to an increasingly illiterate TV cultured society. Once they're hooked on iBooks its still not the¬†end for eBook readers, no, it's a wake up call. The manufacturers can raise their game, not necessarily to add features, but to perform the simple task of displaying and browsing an electronic book, only better. Colour eink, touch displays (everyone who picks up my Nook and the Kindle before that¬†intuitively¬†try to tap the screen) are a few features that spring to mind.<br /><br />Already Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble have released some major Kindle and Nook updates. The Kindle is to get an SDK (KDK actually) and the Nook has had a facelift (see below) along with a much needed speed and battery life boost. It's good to see continued support and development for these devices. Although having played with the Nook for a while, rooting it (similar to jailbreaking an iPhone,) installing a web browser, feed reader and other apps, I've found them to be an annoying distraction to what I prefer to use it on most, actual reading! The only third-party Nook app I wouldn't be without is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trook</a>, which allows me to download books from my <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2009/10/high-calibre/">Calibre library</a> at home, including daily &quot;newspapers&quot; compiled from RSS feeds and that's only because I'm too tight to buy actual eNewspapers. :)<br /></p>  <p>The Nook's New Look - From stylish and minimalist to glossy and &quot;Windows XP&quot; like.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><img title="newnook" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/5a724a4d29.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="90"><img title="newnook2" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/47cc198c81.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="88"></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>Footnote: The latest update to the Nook has really transformed it into a very capable device which¬†negates most of the original concerns I mentioned in <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2010/01/worlds-most-advanced-ebook-reader/">an earlier review</a>. Although I prefer the Nook, there are still three important features missing which are available in the Kindle, the ability to export notes, rotation of display and the sorting of books by date.</p>

         	<p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/1d496ea428.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="307">This weekend Starbucks released VIA Ready Brew, their take on instant coffee, throughout the UK. To coincide with the launch they ran a series of tastings pitting the Colombian and Italian Roast VIA against their &quot;freshly&quot; brewed Colombian and House Blend. Starbucks isn't known in the industry for the freshness of it's beans. Nearly two years ago I <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2008/12/the-starbucks-contradiciton/">blogged</a> about a change in message from Starbucks USA; admitting they had had quality problems and launching a new house blend &quot;Pike Place&quot; which would be in stores within two weeks of roasting. Although expected at the time, this return to freshness never arrived in Europe. Less than a year later, in what seemed a contradictory move, Starbucks entered the Instant market with VIA; 100% microground soluble coffee bean, however that's done.<br /><br />When I finally got a sample I was left very confused, here's why:<br /><br />Pro<br /></p>  <ul> <br /><li>VIA tastes and smells almost identical to Starbucks brewed coffee.</li> <br /><li>It's better than any other Instant.</li> <br /><li>It's 100% bean, unlike the content of Instant</li> <br /> </ul>  <p><br />Con<br /></p>  <ul> <br /><li>VIA tastes and smells almost identical to Starbucks brewed coffee. Not exactly a good starting point, if the production process for VIA was used on high quality fresh beans, I wonder how they would turn out.</li> <br /><li>It's NOT freshly brewed coffee. No Instant, Starbucks or otherwise will ever beat a properly prepared cup of freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee.</li> <br /><li>This is where it get's¬†weird, because it is actually real coffee, it's susceptible to problems with roasting, so one batch can be darker than another. This seems to be the case with the 3 and 12 pack Colombian. The 3 pack (with best before Nov 2010) tastes burnt, but less fresh (best before April 2010) 12 pack is actually mild and quite drinkable.</li> <br /> </ul>  <p><br />This last point¬†surprises¬†me and hints to a possible lack of quality control, unusual for a company synonymous with producing¬†homogenous¬†products; at least it assures you that it's real coffee.<br /><br />Another issue, brought up on Saturday at Open Coffee Banbridge, was that VIA is not Fairtrade; despite Starbucks' promotion last¬†year, that all their coffee is now Fairtrade. Another¬†apparent contradiction to their existing message. I've already <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2007/08/fair-trade/">written</a> about Fairtrade's strengths and weaknesses. Yes it's good for consumers to buy Fairtrade, providing they realise that it is not the only or even best way to give farmers a fair price; for companies it's a completely different matter. Too often used as ready-made promotion, Fairtrade is the <strong>bare minimum</strong> that a business can and should do to be ethically responsible. The Bible says that &quot;all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.&quot; This isn't the correct exegetical¬†interpretation, but when a business switches to Fairtrade for the wrong reasons, it is nothing more than filthy rags, a front, which I hope the customer can see past. Through the release of VIA without it being Fairtrade, is it possible that this is the case with Starbucks?<br /><br />Taste and Fairtrade aside, the real VIA challenge however, is to convince the UK public to spend 50 pence on an individual sachet of coffee!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Recently in Church, our senior minister commented on how two of the hymns sang had been penned by people who had lived during the period of the 1859 Revival. A quick scan through the hymn book showed that a huge number of of our traditional hymns originate from that period.</p>  <p>If a work of revival results in such a volume of verse being produced, then perhaps it is not too far a leap to suggest that the so called ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with modern worship music is that having not originated during a period of revival the words and music are not inspired of the Holy Spirit in the same way. There may be a degree of truth there but I first I feel that it‚Äôs necessary to look back to various times of revival so that we can properly define the term, before making such judgements.</p>  <p><strong>What is Revival?</strong></p>  <p>The Bible show records multiple accounts of revival although not necessarily using that word; the repentance of Nineveh and the day of Pentecost being two that spring immediately to mind.</p>  <p><em>‚ÄúAnd Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. So the people of Nineveh believed God‚Äù Jonah 3:4-5</em></p>  <p>How bad were these nations but God still worked with them? Well Jonah was so afraid and hated the people of Nineveh so much, that he ran from God‚Äôs instruction and the Jews on the day of pentecost were the city that just crucified Jesus. Both times a wicked and rebellious generation were miraculously turned to the things God.</p>  <p>Wikipedia defines Revival as ‚Äúa term that generally refers to a specific period of increased spiritual interest or renewal in the life of a church congregation or many churches, either regionally or globally.‚Äù Church history paints events such as the 1859 Revival, the American Awakenings or the Welsh Revival as joyous and blessed times when the Lord worked in power and people were saved. Indeed that is what happened, and then some. It would be naive of us to assume that a such a massive working of God happened during the periods mentioned and then outside of that time period life returned to normal. No, instead revival is a continual working of the Holy Spirit throughout the course a generation. Reports of the 1859 revival in Ireland show how society was turned upside down by the people coming to God; it was those lives who were touched by the revivals of the 19th Century that went on to pen these great inspired hymns.</p>  <p>At this point, I should mention that Wikipedia should almost never be used as a source when trying to make a serious point, but if you bear with me it does actually fit very well into my train of thought. On the page regarding revival it says</p>  <p><em>‚ÄúCoincidentally, the very month that Jeremiah Lanphier began his prayer meeting in New York, four young Irishmen began a weekly prayer meeting in the village of Connor near Ballymena.‚Äù¬†</em></p>  <p>Clearly the work of a historian rather than a believer, you may say, as the word ‚Äúcoincidentally‚Äù should in fact read ‚Äúprovidentially.‚Äù But on a topic such as the 1859 Revival, in Ireland, primarily in the North , it‚Äôs very likely that the person adding it to Wikipedia would be a Christian and if so then therein lies our problem. We might be remembering back to the days of revival and praying that God would send another, but we the Christian church, don‚Äôt actually believe it will happen!</p>  <p><strong>The Digital Revival</strong></p>  <p>There‚Äôs finally been a great move in the last few years towards all kinds of digital media, online broadcasts and use of social networks. As times change, it‚Äôs important the the techniques we use to deliver the message of the gospel change with them. As the printing press revolutionised how Bibles and books are published and distributed so the internet has and is changing things yet again. We should always remember however that as the means of the delivery changes, the message should not; a pitfall that the contemporary church has fallen into; marketing Jesus as a brand to rival other lifestyle choices.</p>  <p>It goes without saying that care and accountability should always be exerted when using new technology, but on top of that we need to consider how it is actually used. A new church website is all well and good, especially if aims to draw in and inform sinners, but if it is designed to please members and existing christians who can stand back and say ‚Äúwow, that‚Äôs a great website‚Äù then it really is missing the mark.</p>  <p><strong>Their Foot Shall Slide</strong></p>  <p>In his famous sermon &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; Jonathan Edwards quotes Deut 32:35 &quot;Their foot shall slide in due time.&quot; He talks about a people who despite God's previous blessing &quot;remained void of counsel, having no understanding in them&quot;</p>  <p>For all we know revival could be underway right now, somewhere else. It could even be happening as a result of the message being sent out digitally. Just¬†because¬†it is not happening where we are does not mean that it is not a revival. Has our foot slipped? Is God no longer working us because we no longer have a true understanding of the Gospel. What we need to pray against is that our longing for the past would get in the way of the gospel message for the future, lest God‚Äôs blessing would move on to somewhere else. In the past it has been seen that revival has arrived as almost a direct response to corruptness, indifference or false teaching in established churches and has resulted in new churches and denominations forming.</p>  <p>For example just because God worked in Northern Ireland in the 1950s, it does not mean that he will automatically bless the work a few generations later. Unless we stay true to the Bible and continue to reach out to the unsaved around us with Biblical love and humility; not just preaching sola fide, sola gratia, solo Christo but also Semper Reformanda.</p>  <ul> <li>‚ÄùFaith alone by grace alone, through Christ alone‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúAlways reforming‚Äù</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

         	<p>Perhaps not 90%, but a large part of what we believe and practice is derived from social, cultural and denominational traditions, not the Bible. What we assume to be true takes the place of what God says¬†<em>is¬†</em>true, when instead we should be living our lives with the guiding light of scripture.</p>  <p>What you are about to read does not come from the pen of a particular denomination, or preacher, but from a Christian, who like Martin Luther read from the Bible and wondered why the teaching within was not being applied correctly or consistently by those that promote it most.</p>  <p>The aim of this discourse is not to cause upset or strife within the Church, but to encourage discussion and to educate fellow Christian on¬†<em>why</em>¬†they believe what they do, so that their life may have a more firm grounding in the Gospel. Finally if anything you read contains theological errors, or incorrect interpretation then bring it to us that we may learn and correct our mistake so as not to be stumbling block to others.</p>

         	<p><img title="EdubuntuVertLogo" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/d372cf6ebe.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160">In September 2009 I began teaching in Mourne Independent Christian School, a small private Primary and Secondary school in Kilkeel. Along with my teaching responsibilities I also inherited the privilege (and it is actually a privilege) of setting the IT policy and managing the IT infrastructure. With the blessing of the principal and school committee I set about replacing the ageing computer room expanding the network to allow teachers to have IT resources in their classrooms. Through the <a href="http://www.mar.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/">Community Microsoft Authorised Refurbisher</a> (MAR) programme, we were able to get ¬†2-3 year old, ex-governement Dell desktops, very capable machines which met our requirements and then some. Although having never heard about it before this programme allows <a href="http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/topics/waste/32084.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WEEE</a> disposal contractors to refresh and resell old hardware.A few weeks ago we took delivery (actually I collected in the back of a Vauxhall Agila) of our new desktops and over the course of the past week, with the help of some very eager pupils, we stripped out the old and connected up the new.<br /><br />Open source software has always been of great interest to me, both from a moral and from a geek point of view. I've always preferred Linux as an alternative Operating System to Windows and especially over the last few years it has grown into an incredibly useable everyday system. The maturity of the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> distribution would allow us to have a secure, reliable and fully loaded learning platform, for free, which would work the way we wanted. Without even a second thought the decision was made to switch from Windows to Ubuntu 9.10 (with <a href="http://edubuntu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edubuntu</a> packages installed) for desktops, using the default GNOME desktop for high school pupils and the <a href="http://www.sugarlabs.org/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">OLPC Sugar </a>interface for the primary school. Having tested it in Parallels, for a server we choose ¬†<a href="http://www.ebox-platform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ebox</a>, itself based on Ubuntu 8.04. Configuring it as a content filter, print, file and OpenLDAP server we have been able to set it, and the Ubuntu desktops, so that each pupil and staff member has a roaming profile with private and public networked Documents folders. Having installed several similar, larger Window Server based solutions, this was not only easier, more user friendly and free but after a long hard week it was a real feel good moment to see the new computer room booted up for the first time yesterday.<br /><br />With ICT classes resuming after half term, pupils in the midst of CLAIT exams will be able use Microsoft Office under CX Office, but by September all pupils will have migrated to OpenOffice.org.<br /><br /><img title="EdubuntuHardy" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/0759dd84cd.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240"><br /><br />Teachers will have to learn the new system, but as some have already commented its very user friendly and intuitive. The biggest challenge will be fully utilise the huge range of educational software available in our lesson plans. I don't think it'll take long, the level of excitement and interest among staff and student alike is not something you'd see after rolling out another C2K network. Ubuntu is going to be a real asset to the school for the foreseeable future and as a friend alluded to earlier will help produce pupils with some <em>real</em> IT skills.</p>

         	<p>So reads the strap line for<a href="http://nook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Barnes &amp; Noble Nook</a>. For those of you who aren't familiar with American book retailers, Wikipedia says:</p>  <blockquote><strong>Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc.</strong> is the largest book¬†<a title="Retailing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retailing">retailer</a> in the¬†<a title="United States" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>,¬†operating mainly through its¬†<em>Barnes &amp; Noble Booksellers</em> chain of¬†<a title="Bookstore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookstore">bookstores</a> headquartered in lower¬†<a title="Fifth Avenue" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> in¬†<a title="Manhattan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.</blockquote>  <p><img title="baltimore-harbor-barnes-and-noble-80_4" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/7eb96862e1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" />I should mention at this point that I have a great fondness for Barnes &amp; Noble, having visited this amazing (and huge) store in Baltimore in 2000, it may have had something to do with this being the first book shop I'd ever been in which had a cafe (great idea btw.)</p>  <p>Equatable with <a href="http://www.waterstones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterstone's</a> here in the UK, B&amp;N operate both on the high street and online, selling physical and electronic books and a range of ebook readers. In late 2009 B&amp;N launched their own reader, the Nook, into an increasingly crowded marketplace, in direct competition with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C/ref=amb_link_40449822_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=16JMZWB4S6YX9P0W5JJF&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=81433282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's Kindle 2</a>. In what would seem to be lessons learnt from competitors, Amazon and Sony, the Nook featured both a 6&quot; e-ink display <em>and</em> an LCD touchscreen, avoiding the Kindle's sluggish e-ink based menu navigation and the glare from the Reader Touch. Powered by Android and featuring both an AT&amp;T 3G Sim and Wifi for OTA purchases, on first glance the Nook seemed to represent the next generation of ebook readers, but after initial reviews hit the internet, it seemed that was not the case. The Nook's Android (1.5) OS was accused of being unstable and buggy and page turns were slooow. Hackers at <a href="http://www.nookdevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nookdevs</a> discovered the whole operating system ran of a MicroSD card, which gave users the impression that the slowness was a hardware problem, rather than a problem that could be fixed with firmware. Along with delays of Christmas Nook orders (well into the new year) and the talk of an impending &quot;Kindle killer&quot; from Apple, the Nook seems to have dropped from off the tech radar entirely for most people. I am not most people.</p>  <p>After determining my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015TG12Q/ref=amb_link_18069902_2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0H12GAXPV6FMAS7N356B&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=51296322&amp;pf_rd_i=1284007011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kindle DX</a> was just too big for reading novels (in the interim, my usage patterns had changed along with my job) and so after selling the DX, my options seemed to be the aforementioned Kindle 2 or the Sony Reader Touch. After checking out <a href="http://www.marramgrass.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark's Sony Touch</a> I felt the glare was too much for me; I liked the idea of the International 3G on the Kindle 2, but it's limited to Amazon and Wikipedia only, so not a huge advantage then. The Nook, on the other hand, had in the interim received two firmware updates, improving speed and stability, had been rooted (similar to jailbreaking an iPhone) and could now run a Web browser, Pandora and could download directly from Stanza and <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2009/10/high-calibre/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibre libraries</a> using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nookapps/wiki/TrookDocumentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trook</a>. All using wifi, meaning they would work in the UK, unlike the Nook's 3G, starting to sound good?</p>  <p><img title="150px-B&amp;N_nook_Logo" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/27eceb0c30.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="62" /></p>  <p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.usunlocked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USUnlocked.com</a> I was able to order a Nook and have it sent to the UK, for less than the price of a Kindle 2 (which adds tax, shipping and customs charges to its base price) and have been putting it through it's paces over the past week. Initially I had planned a technical review in this post, but after some sage advice, I'm going to hold it off for another time along the some hi-res photos. Leaving this post to focus on my initial hands on reaction.</p>  <ul> <ul>     <li>The packaging is pretty, Apple pretty, but nigh on impossible to get into, unless you are a member of mensa. In fact it's so nice, that I've used the sleeve and an old moleskine notebook to create a tidy case.</li> </ul> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>The Nook is solid, but heavy, my wife reckons that it's heavier than the Kindle DX, but Wikipedia disagrees.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>I've read that the design of the Nook is plasticky and cheap looking, but I find it quite stylish.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>It fits nicely into your hand thanks to an ergonomically curved back.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>All ebook readers should come with the default screensaver saying &quot;Don't Panic.&quot; It should become law or something.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Boot-up takes forever and a day, although resume from sleep is very fast, possibly faster than the Kindle.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Once you update to firmware 1.1.1 page turns are fine, not bearable, not slower than the Kindle, fine, meaning not a problem.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Once rooted you can do all kinds of fun stuff like replacing fonts (I like Georgia) and using Trook, letting me download books and news feeds from my Calibre library</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>The touch screen is not an iPhone, but it's useable, more so than the Kindle DX's keyboard</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Unless you turn Airplane mode on and set the touchscreen backlight timer to 10s, the battery drains within a day or two. With those set, you might get a week, we'll see.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Like the Kindle the Nook doesn't use folders to sort books, unlike the Kindle it offers no sort options, books seem to order themselves whatever way they feel.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Removing the back cover is ok, but it makes scary cracking noises, so be brave.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>Inside you have a MicroSD slot, removable battery (sort of) and a sim card, remove more of the casing and as reported there is another MicroSD slot containing the file system and OS.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>I like the size and shape.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>The screen has great contrast and is helped further by the black strip around it. With black text on a grey screen, I'm surprised so many e-readers come in white, the black helps create an optical illusion that the grey background is whiter than it really is, making it more readable. True fact.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>B&amp;N's store has access to Google's library of 1 million e-books, I've found some real gems that don't even show up on the Google Books website. Getting these on a Kindle was a nightmare, well, not as easy.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>There is no rotate function, because:</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>PDF reflow is awesome, you can scale up the fonts in any document (providing it has fonts), similar to the Sony Reader Touch.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>     <li>PDB files can be searched quicker and jumped about in faster than EPUBs.</li> </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The Nook has been a pleasant surprise, it has its flaws, which I'll go into in my next post, but overall it's a great device. Is it the world's most advanced e-book reader? Probably not, especially when technology moves so fast. Is it the best e-book reader for me? Only time will tell.</p>  <p>I'd love to hear what my readers think about e-book readers, do you have one, would you buy another, what features do they need, or is there no point to them at all?

Most importantly this random, free and open networking group has, for a lot of us, created real-world friendships.<br /><br />The openness and social nature of Open Coffee, compared to the strict regimented structure of other business networking groups, such as <a href="http://www.bni.com/">BNI</a> means that we can try different things. So on Saturday 16 January, we'll be having our first Open Coffee Lisburn outside of Lisburn, in Banbridge. &quot;On Tour&quot; as I like to call it, we'll be meeting at 9:30AM in Starbucks at The Outlet. With most attendees being married and with kids, we encourage you to bring the family along too, it'll be a great social event.<br /><br />If you've never been along to an Open Coffee meeting, this is the perfect opportunity to come along and meet the group.<br /><br />You can contact us on twitter through <a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn"><a href="http://twitter.com/oclisburn">http://twitter.com/oclisburn</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><br /></a>The majority of us are on Google Wave and if you add me, I can invite you to the group - andrewgribben.com@googlewave.com<br />And finally, you can keep up with our events by subscribing to our <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/tvisted.net_t67cuuc5rf1oq9egt9cpagpevg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iCal</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/tvisted.net_t67cuuc5rf1oq9egt9cpagpevg%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics"></a></p>

The goal being to produce a version of the Scriptures for various e-book readers which, within the constraints of the device, has a <strong>useable</strong> user interface and readable layout.<br /><br />Many, many versions already exist around the web, but either have hideously formatted text or are far too unwieldy to fit into typical usage patterns for the Bible. Of course others have been working on this problem, <a href="http://osnovapress.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Osnova</a> has produced several Bibles and developed a jump to verse technique using the search function of the device. Type ge.1.10 and find and the reader will jump to the Genesis chapter 1 verse 10.<br /><br />I've used a similar technique, by hiding a code for chapter using white coloured text (doesn't show on the device but is still searchable) you can enter Gen.1, Matt.1 etc and the reader leaps to the correct chapter. As far as the reading experience goes, each verse flow into one another, with verse numbers showing in a smaller font.<br /><br />Very soon I'll have an Open Bible Project website up and running, hosting the scriptures and various reference books online. Each user of the website will be able to annotate, highlight and link text across books of the Bible and the reference library. This customised version of the Bible will be available (freely) as a download for use on your reader, bringing those highlights, notes and links with it.</p>

At this point you can add it as a bookmark to the homescreen, giving you a nice Wave icon and remove those browser controls. It's flakey but it quite useable.<br /><br />I'm not sure what will come from Wave, it could be the next Gmail, or the next Orkut, either way it'll be an interesting journey.<br /><br />[gallery columns="4"  lightboxsize="full"]</p>

         	<p>When no one sticks to them? After reading <a href="http://alaninbelfast.blogspot.com/2009/11/market-boat-fire-lease-woolly-hats-and.html">Alan's post</a> on 4x4s parked badly at Sainsburys, it reminded me of something that's really got on my nerves lately, people that park in parent and baby spaces, that have no children with them, sometimes even be a work van! <br />The worst culprits seem to be found at Tesco Banbridge and although security have advised to complain to management, they claim it keeps happening and nothing is ever done long term to resolve it. What's doubly frustrating is that Tesco have a parent and baby club which they get you to sign up to and in return, give you a &quot;parking pass&quot; of sorts to allow you to use these spaces. A good idea in principle, but I've never noticed anyone use them, but besides that, what's the point of this scheme if it isn't going to be enforced?</p>

         	<p>I've been using the Amazon Kindle DX, in the UK, for <a href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/2009/07/amzon-kindle/">a while</a> now and have grown to love it's ability to display PDF, more than any other feature. Until recently once feature which I had never really used was subscribing to Newspapers, that is until I discovered <a href="http://calibre.kovidgoyal.net/">Calibre.</a></p>  <p>Calibre is a free, open source, cross-platform ebook management software. It's like iTunes (the way it used to be) for books, but kinda uglier. Looks may not be it's strong point, but it is great for managing your library, converting formats (DRM free of course), renaming books and meta information individually or en masse. One feature I hadn't made use of, was it's ability to generate a newspaper from an RSS feed. What surprised me even further was that on the DX, the newspaper displayed in the exact same way, with a section list etc, as the newspapers from Amazon. Very nice when the blog or news site you use doesn't have and issue to buy on Amazon, even nicer when you're in the UK and Amazon have blocked purchases from outside the US.</p>  <p>But wait, it doesn't stop there, Calibre goes as far as to contain &quot;recipes&quot; which are used to scrape text from certain websites. Web page scraping might be a controversial feature, but if you want a newspaper created from BBC News or a your unread Google Reader articles, then there's a recipe for that. It's even possible to customise your recipe by adding new feeds, so my BBC Newspaper now contains a section for news in Northern Ireland just after the headlines. You can see how it turns out, below.</p>  <p>[gallery link="file" order="DESC"]</p>

Rising above it all is the extremely tall and growing Obel Tower; here's what Wikipedia has to say:<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obel_Tower"><em>The Obel Tower is a building currently under construction in Belfast, Northern Ireland.<br />Costing ¬£85 million and measuring 80.5 metres (265 ft) in height, the tower when completed is set to dominate the Belfast skyline. It will overtake the current tallest skyscraper in Ireland, Windsor House (80 m), also in Belfast. Developed by the Karl Group, the Obel Tower is located on Donegall Quay on the River Lagan beside the Lagan Weir.</em></a><br /><br />My brother, Mark, an architecture student at <a href="http://ulster.ac.uk/">UUJ</a>, recently got a look around inside, here are a few of his photos. Just look at how small the other buildings are and he wasn't even at the top!<br /><br />[gallery link="file"]</p>

Sorry about that!<br /><br />What happened was that I was trying to link a few social network sites together; I wanted photos posted to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/colonelgrib">flickr</a> to automatically create a blog post and then for the blog to send out a tweet. Sure you can do this with <a href="http://posterous.com/">posterous</a>, but any blog posts created have photos linked back to their site, not flickr. <br /><br />Using RSS and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-o-matic/">WP-O-Matic</a> plugin I had planned for a new post to be created when new photos were added to flickr's RSS feed. But... I forgot I had the other plugin turned on, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">TwitterTools</a> which automatically sends out a tweet for each post and you can image what happened.<br /><br />So for anyone following me in various clients including SMS (@wiseguyrussell), I humbly ask for your forgiveness and promise that next time I'm working without enough sleep, I'll be more careful.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/kindlecloseup-768x1024.jpg"><img title="kindlecloseup" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/64e61c3dd8.jpg" alt="kindlecloseup" width="225" height="300"></a>I'm probably breaking all the rules, but I'm going to start with a conclusion, the Amazon Kindle DX is an amazing device. End of post...<br /><br />...Or at least it would be if I lived in the USA. The Kindle with it's built-in &quot;Whispernet&quot; allows for purchasing and downloading books from Amazon and browsing Wikipedia and the web freely (apart from book cost obviously)  until your heart's content, providing you have cellular (Sprint?) coverage in the area. Living in the UK, I'm somewhat out of that coverage area, so even after crossing the hurdle of ordering from an Amazon.com account, delivering to a US address and then getting it brought back here, you're limited to USB only transfer. After all that is it still appealing? Like the man from delmonte, I say &quot;Yes!&quot;<br /><br />Fair enough you are losing some of the best additional features of the Kindle, but let's remember, what they are <em>additional features.</em> The Kindle DX is the e-book reader that makes other readers like the Sony and even Kindle 2, cry and run away. <a rel="lightbox" href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/img_0058batman-781x1024.jpg"><img title="E-ink sceen" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/5a9293e1ea.jpg" alt="E-ink sceen" width="229" height="300"></a><br />It's got a big 9.7&quot; highly contrasted e-ink screen, about (haven't actually checked) 3.5GB of storage (which I've now filled), it's slim, light, looks cool, renders PDF,  but more important than all that, you can actually enjoy an e-book like a real book! I know the purists out there are going to wax lyrical about paper, the feel of a book and bla, bla bla... You know what? I don't care. I love books too, but if I'm going on holiday or doing some development work, the last think I want is lugging a suitcase/bag around filled with books, <em>especially</em> text books.<br /><br />That's why the Kindle DX, in my eyes, is a winner, it's an iPod for books, I can still have all the classics on my fuax-intellectual bookshelves, but if I'm going to leave the house and need a half-dozen iPhone dev books, I'll be talking the Kindle DX with me. And on a technical note, the refreshing of the e-ink screen is not as jarring as I expected, and performance wise it can open most books and PDFs about as quickly as an iPhone 3G can open an app :P<br /><br /><a rel="lightbox" href="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/img_0056k-768x1024.jpg"><img title="img_0056k" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/9a1723e2d0.jpg" alt="img_0056k" width="225" height="300"></a>Of course, before I even got a book on the device I'd already installed a hack from <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=45528&amp;highlight=usbnetwork">here</a> which gave me SSH access and after a bit more jiggery-pokery let me share out my MacBook's internet connection and browse the Amazon Store on the Kindle. <strong>Important note</strong> if you plan on doing this yourself the one piece of advice I can give is this:<br /></p>  <blockquote>Register the device with your Amazon.com account while it's still in the US.</blockquote>  <p><br />Otherwise, although you can browse the store, without registering, you can't make any purchases or use the web bowser via the reverse tether. Some might say it's a bit pointless anyway since you have to be connected to a PC anyway, but I'd still like the option, for completeness sake if nothing else.<br /><br />I'll be waiting for a UK/Europe release and further playing with the device, but most of all I'll be reading.<br /><br />If you've any questions or thoughts, you can catch me on twitter <a href="https://micro.blog/grib">@grib</a><br /><br />[gallery link="file"]</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><p>We had a bit of a discussion last night at Xcake about the MacBook sleep time. Since switching to Intel chips MacBooks use what is called Safe Sleep, which suspends your RAM to Hard Disk when you shut the lid. The standard habit of a Mac user since PowerPC days was to shut the lid and throw in your bag, however on safe sleep it can take between 25 and 45 seconds to actually sleep, during that time the disk is likely still spinning.</p>  <div><br /></div>  <div>There is another way. By disabling Safe Sleep, you can have a PowerPC like sleep time of around 5 to 8 seconds.</div>  <div><br /></div>  <div><b>Disabling Safe Sleep</b></div>  <div>To disable safe sleep, run the two following commands in Terminal:</div>  <div> <br /><div>sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0</div> <div>sudo nvram &ldquo;use-nvramrc?&rdquo;=false</div> <div><br /></div> <div>Reboot your Mac and upon resume issue the following command to delete the sleep image from your Hard Disk and free some room.</div> <div><br /></div> <div>sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage</div> <div><br /></div> <div><b>Disadvantages</b></div> <div>I&rsquo;ve been disabling safe sleep for years, ever since I first got an Intel Mac, and have had no issues apart from:</div> <div>If your battery gets too low, eg below 5%, Safe Sleep will save your session to disk. Without safe sleep, the Mac battery will be drained and it ¬†will be as if you had switched it off.</div> <div>So before you try this, ask yourself, how often do you let your MacBook run out of power?</div> <div><br /></div> <div><b>Re-enabling Safe Sleep</b></div> <div>To switch Safe Sleep back on again, type the following in Terminal:</div> <div><br /></div> <div> <div>sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3</div> <div>sudo nvram &ldquo;use-nvramrc?&rdquo;=true</div> <div><br /></div> <div>Reboot and you&rsquo;re as good as new!</div> </div> <div><br /></div> <div><br /></div> <div><br /></div> </div>  <pre><code>  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://posterous.com/&quot;&gt;Posted">http://posterous.com/&quot;&gt;Posted</a> via email&lt;/a&gt;   from &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://andrewgribben.posterous.com/macbook-safe-sleep&quot;&gt;Grib's">http://andrewgribben.posterous.com/macbook-safe-sleep&quot;&gt;Grib's</a> Stuff&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt; </code></pre></p>

         	<p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/14d365641a.jpg" alt="">The ever pleasant, ever knowledgeable <a href="http://twitter.com/hasbean">Steve Leighton</a> of <a href="http://hasbean.co.uk/">Has Bean</a> fame, kindly lent me a prototype coffee roaster last month at the cost of a review. Being me, I promptly <del datetime="2009-06-04T08:53:39+00:00">got caught up</del> forgot about it and so last night was actually the first time I got to power it on. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />For those of you that have never heard of the <a href="http://www.behmor.com/">Behmor 1600</a>, it's a home coffee roaster that's been on sale in the States for a while now and the developer of it will soon(?) be releasing a model that works on the juicier 240V we have at this side of the Atlantic. What's so special about this roaster you ask? Well as Tom at <a href="http://sweetmarias.com/">Sweet Maria's</a> says &quot;There's finally a home coffee roaster that can truly do a full pound of coffee!&quot; that's 453g in new money. That's a great weight, roughly twice what I can roast in my Gene Cafe and it has a host of amazing features, quiet roasts, smoke free, consistent roasts etc.<br /><br />So what did I think of it?<em><br />Well first off, it's a great size, pretty much the same a our microwave, which means it can happily sit on the worktop and not look like a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=gene%20cafe&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">warp core</a> which keeps my wife happy.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.freshcoffeebeans.com/images/Behmor_CPanel_sm.jpg" alt=""><br />The control panel looks quite complicated and the <a href="http://www.behmor.com/pdf/Behmor_Manual_full_v3.6.pdf">manual</a> even more so. I can almost forgive that, as the major of users will be coffee geeks, but I had to read it through twice just to be sure I was doing things right and that does seem excessive, either that I was just having a really stupid day, who knows?<br /><br />The smokeless filter is a nice touch and does a really good job up to a Full City (ish) level, after that you're likely to get a charcoal'd bean anyway, but as a lb of colombian decaff found out last night, no amount of smoke filtering will help when your beans roasted to the point of starting a fire. Which brings me to the negative...<br /><br />Visibility. Frankly it's terrible. Due to the nature of the machine you really have to open the door and remove the chaff tray during the roast (which will affect the internal temperature) to have a good look at the beans. The above problem happened because I ended up shining a maglite in to see how the roast was getting on and completely misjudged it. This paragraph was originally going to be quite scathing, but I found out after cleaning there is actually a light inside the roaster (the clue being the button marked &quot;light&quot; on the panel. So maybe I was having a stupid day after all) however the bulb in this model wasn't working, I'm assuming it's just went during transit/usage or because it's a protoype, but I'll get that replaced today and I'm sure it'll be a help.<br /><br />In summary, the Behmor 1600 is an innovative roaster which is intended to live in your kitchen, like any other appliance, with a wide range of temperature profiles and settings it more than makes up for over complicated instructions and will probably help you understand the coffee roasting process better anyway.<br /><br />In the next part of my review I'll be looking at the pre-set curves and range of roasts available and then wrap up by comparing and cupping roasts against my other home roasters.<br /><br /></em>Remember these are just my initial thoughts and I will continue to make posts as I roast with it more.</p>

I've already one app approved (pending contracts) and about to submit my second after only two days development time. That's not from cutting corners or bad coding, but because so much of the work is done for you by Xcode. I've taken the week off work to do some serious coding, so I may be off twitter for the next few days, but at least now you know where I'll be :)</p>

         	<p>I was pleasantly surprised after heading home from Open Coffee Lisburn tonight, to find a nice email from Apple telling me the <a href="http://exilecoffee.com/">Exile Coffee</a> &quot;Find Me Coffee&quot; app was now &quot;Ready for sale&quot;</p>  <p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/697d413d97.jpg" height="69" align="right" width="300">Unfortunately it's not that simple, I seemed to have overlooked part of my banking setup on iTunes Connect. I'll get that sorted out right now, but hopefully the app will be ready available soon.

I hope it doesn't hi-jack the whole meet-up but it seems to have been the proverbial straw which broke the camel's back and has infuriated up a lot of local people. The¬†bureaucratic incompetence and &quot;it's all about who you know&quot; attitude in Lisburn City Council seems to get everyone's goat.<em></li> <br /><li>Secondly, the fact in trying to organise a meeting on a Tuesday night in a &quot;city&quot; we suddenly couldn't find a venue, apart from in what is now a burger bar. Even if we had waited until Wednesday night, Market Lane Cafe closes at 7pm with only Cafe Latte staying open late (Wed-Sat until 9PM). Why can't we have late night openings every night? Speaking from experience, (and you can check with many other business owners) the council and police are only <span>interested</span> able to focus on areas with a high footfall (and high amount of existing civil disturbance) namely the Omniplex. Outside the complex and you are completely an utterly alone. Don't count on the security cameras either, we're not even sure that they work and when they do are only pointed at the ATMs.</li> <br /> </ol>  <p><br /></p>  <p></em>Too many animal metaphors in one paragraph, apologies.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><p><a name="more"></a><br />Coffee is a passion for me, anyone who has talked to me, knows I could wax lyrical about it. I¬†thoroughly¬†enjoyed being at last month&rsquo;s Farmer&rsquo;s Market and spent the following four weeks looking forward to it, preparing new beans and telling everyone that would listen about how great it was to have something like this in Lisburn. Yesterday, despite being there to sell <a href="http://beanandgone.com/">BEAN AND GONE</a> coffee beans I was told, mid-market, to stop giving away sample drinks, because it was affecting the business of another trader. Annoyed and offended, I sent out a quick <a href="http://twitter.com/beanandgone/status/1451026567">tweet</a> and was shocked by the near instant support of the local online community. Russell (@wiseguyrussell) has posted about it on his <a href="http://russellmcquillan.com/2009/04/04/lisburn-farmers-market-farce/">blog</a> and others <a href="https://micro.blog/blackconfetti">@blackconfetti</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/odle2">@odle2</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/maramgrass">@maramgrass</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/stuartgibson">@stuartgibson</a>, <a href="https://micro.blog/wiredbob">@wiredbob</a> expressed their indignation, both in person and online.<br /><br />People have been talking about free trade and the unfairness of having a market that allows no duplication. I signed up for the market knowing this and accepted that I couldn&rsquo;t sell coffee drinks and only give samples away.¬†I wanted to write a detailed timeline of what has been happening and allow everyone to make up their own minds.<br /><br /><br /></p>  <ul> <br /><li> <strong>October 18th 2008<br /><span>The first Farmer&rsquo;s market in Castle Gardens, I popped in while walking past, thought it was great to see in Lisburn (and still do), I even bought a coffee from Javaman.<br />Bumped into Sharon from Soupernatural (responsible for creating and organising the market), who suggested I come along to the next market held at:</span></strong><strong></strong> </li> <br /><li><strong>December 2008<br /><span>I Had planned to attend selling coffee beans, even contacted the council (the organiser being Suzanne Lutton) to get forms, however the fact that the council required a Risk¬†assessment¬†form the length of your arm and¬†Public Indemnity Insurance put the brakes on that. Paying out around ¬£80 on Insurance in what was thought, at the time ,to be a one-off seemed like a bit steep, add to the that the cost of the pitch, being nearly double that of the likes of St George&rsquo;s market.<br />I stopped by the market anyway, bought some nice food, (noticed Javaman wasn&rsquo;t there this time) and again talked to Sharon from Soupernatural who told me I should have came along anyway and let their insurance cover me. She told me the market was going to start back and go monthly from:</span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong>February<br /><span>I saw a banner go up for the Lisburn Farmer&rsquo;s Market on 7th March and contacted Sharon to see if it was ok to come along.<br />I got a call back the next day, from Suzanne Lutton from Lisburn City Council, telling me that although they&rsquo;d be happy to have me at the market, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to trade using Soupernatural&rsquo;s insurance. Understandable really, so I arranged my own, as well as ordering in green beans, packaging, signage etc, only to get another call back from Suzanne telling me that Phil from Javaman had expressed concern about me selling coffee drinks. An arrangement was made that I would only sell beans and equipment, so as not to affect his business and comply with the non-duplication terms of the market. With all that sorted out I got ready for:</span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong>Saturday 9th March: First Monthly Market<br /><span>Although it was a freezing, wet and overcast day, we had a successful day and as I mentioned above, a lot of fun. So there was no doubt that we planned to go back in:</span></strong></li> <br /><li> <strong>March<br /><span>I got back in touch with Suzanne at the council just to check everything was ok for the next market, she told me it was and checked that I was fine with only doing samples. From here on out I&rsquo;ll break down what happened on the day:</span></strong><strong></strong> </li> <br /><li><strong>Saturday 5th April<br />0815<br /><span>Setup my tent outside the main marquee, got completely soaked and had a short chat with Javaman, I should add that nothing was mentioned about us selling coffee beans</span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong><span><strong>0930<br /><span>Was asked again by Suzanne &ldquo;are you only serving samples&rdquo; despite having already answered this repeatedly. Suzanne&rsquo;s exact words were &ldquo;he (Phil from Javaman) saw you carrying in an espresso machine and¬†is freaking out&rdquo;</span></strong></span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong><span><strong>1100 (ish)<br /><span>Several customers expressed annoyance at not being able to buy a coffee (drinks) from us, although as before I let them know they could buy from Javaman at the back of the tent. It was also noticed that all the other market traders had been provided with printed signage.</span></strong></span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong>1215<br /><span>Sharon from Soupernatural¬†(not the council organiser)¬†came over to our stall and told us we would have to stop giving out samples as it was affecting Phil&rsquo;s trade and there just wasn&rsquo;t enough footfall to justify two traders with the same product. She said that Suzanne from the council would be over to speak to me soon:</span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong>1400<br /><span>Not exactly &ldquo;soon&rdquo; and having turned away dozens of customers looking for samples I finally got to speak to Suzanne by going to find her. Suzanne explained the same reasons as Sharon, however she agreed that we should be allowed to give out samples but in small espresso sized cups only. We asked to have it in writing and the following month be inside the main marquee, she said that would be fine.<br />We brought up the issue that the market would never grow, or be competitive while they still had a no duplication policy, Suzanne told us she had at least another 6 traders lined up to come (which I think would be great) but they can&rsquo;t as they overlap with existing traders.<br />On the issue of the printed banners which the other traders got, we were told that we hadn&rsquo;t one because our spot was outside the main marquee and they wouldn&rsquo;t survive well outside. This was understandable and it was pointed out the other outside spot (for which the trader didn&rsquo;t show) didn&rsquo;t have one either.</span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong><span><strong>1445</strong><br /></span><span><span>Sharon came back and informed us that Suzanne (from the council, official organisers etc) should not have told us that we could give out samples at all and that an espresso size sample of filter coffee would stop people buying shots of espresso from Phil. <em>I want to point out here that the standard of coffee and the culture of the UK and Ireland is that someone will not buy a shot of Espresso, unless they¬†truly¬†are a coffee lover, in which case a &ldquo;shot&rdquo; of filter coffee would not suffice or even be considered as the same thing. <span>W</span></em>e were also told that we should not have been at the market at all as when I had first request to come in February, Phil from Javaman had said he would not be happy with me being there at all. Sharon says she passed this information back to Suzanne (although up to that point I had been dealing directly with Sharon) and that the fault was Suzanne&rsquo;s and the Council&rsquo;s for letting me come. She also pointed out that the banners were only printed for the other traders, whom she had invited and arranged with and that our roastery tent outside was nothing to do with her, it was between me and Suzanne. (This contradicted not only Suzanne&rsquo;s earlier reason for us not having signage, but also Sharon&rsquo;s own arguments about who had the say in the running of the market. One moment she has the authority to arrange things, the next we are &ldquo;nothing to do with her&rdquo;). It was left that, we had affected Javaman&rsquo;s business so much that he probably wouldn&rsquo;t be back and that it would damage her reputation as a trader as she had given her word that there would be no duplication, the direction of the conversation was thought the right thing to do would be to leave as us even attending the market was a mistake.</span></span></strong></li> <br /><li><strong>1530<br /><span>I packed up, paid my fee and was told ¬†by Suzanne that she would be in touch, after having spoken to Sharon, so who knows what will happen next?</span></strong></li> <br /> </ul></p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><strong>About Our Ratings</strong></p>  <p>Our ratings are not intended to cause offense, but instead hope to promote quality and good practice in the coffee industry, directing business owners to the areas that need improvement, providing a better experience for all.<a name="more"></a></p>  <p>As such, the breakdown of our reviews, based on the sampling of a small cappuccino, is as follows:</p>  <p><strong>Taste </strong>- Pretty self explanatry, how the coffee tastes. Marked out of 10, most fresh generic coffee's will receive a 7 or 8, outstandingly fresh and exciting coffees will be higher, with stale coffee (usually caused by filling the doser with ground coffee and leaving to sit, or not cleaning group heads between shots) will be lower.</p>  <p><strong>Texture </strong>- The texture of the milk, also marked out of 10. Consistently smooth milk with little or no bubbles, known as microfoam, is the goal here. Frothing milk until it is bubbly and dry tends tomake it sour and points will be lower accordingly.</p>  <p><strong>Temperature</strong> - Leading on from milk frothing, the coffee temperature, again out of 10 with 10 being the perfect drinking temperature, not too hot not too cold. Extreme heat (hotter than your hand can touch, around 140F) not only makes the milk sour, buttwill get you lower points; no one wants their mouth burnt!</p>  <p><strong>Technical Ability </strong>- Marked out of 10, this is a look at the skill and training of the barista preparing the drink. Are they following industry best practices, or ritualistically sticking to bad/incorrect training. Also taken into account are the proportions of the drink, ie the ration of espresso to milk.</p>  <p><strong>Appearance </strong>- Marked out of 5, this is <em>not </em>how the staff look, contrary to popular belief (you know who you are!) but is how the coffee is presented, if it is finished with any latte art, if there have been spills etc.</p>  <p><strong>Atmosphere </strong>- The atmosphere marks relate to the cafe environment itself; is the establishment billed as a &quot;coffee shop&quot; but the main priority is food and a high turn over of customers. As it is not a major issue it is also marked out of 5.</p>  <p>The final score is calculated by adding these values together and doubling to give a mark out of 100</p>  <p><strong>Exclusions </strong>- We have decided to exclude certain coffee chains from our reviews due to bad ratings across their stores. Currently O'Briens, The Streat, Costa Coffee, Cafe Nero and Starbucks are excluded. Although, as I alluded to in an earlier post, Starbucks Coffee, prepared primarily by fully automatic machines, is at least consistent.</p>

A few years ago, no one would believe such a diverse mix of people and countries would be so captivated by the inauguration of an American President, but after the hype and build-up of the past few months, it was thought that perhaps his speech would not deliver, those people were wrong.</p>  <p>President Obama knew not only the eyes of America, but the eyes of the world were upon him and his inaugural address, in this smaller interconnected world, reached out to everyone. Suddenly, it seemed that the whole of twitter, Facebook and everything in between were suddenly doing the same thing. As Obama set new challenges for the American people, a lot of us jumped for joy when he mentioned returning &quot;science to its rightful place.&quot; I'm sure some of you reading this don't understand the implications, President Obama is a committed Christian, as am I, hopefully this will forever dispel the myths held on both sides of the debate that Christianity and Science cannot and do not go together. Science is not the work of the devil, but at the same time neither do we live in the &quot;dark ages&quot; or so desire to. I like my mobile phone, laptop, internet access, nuclear power, NASA, the Human Genome project and even the LHC. I read scientific journals and have a very rational and analytical mind.</p>  <p>Some seem to think that intelligence and reason go against believing in a &quot;higher power.&quot; My intelligence and reason, as with President Obama, are not contrary too, but instead confirm my faith. Faith which does not come from clouded judgement, or impaired mental faculties, but a the very root of it, comes from the empirical evidence that there is a God. Others may complain that what I say is wrong, that faith comes from believing only, but I was a follower of science long before I was a Christian, it was the undeniable proof and complete lack of evidence of the contrary that not only led me to God, but continues with me today.</p>

I have respect for <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/7832647.stm">this guy</a> there are very few people who would stand up for their faith, like that, anymore. Notice the word &quot;faith&quot; it's important, this isn't as simple, as I've seen trivialised on blogs that suggest &quot;would a vegetarian refuse to drive a bus advertising bacon?&quot; In my mind, as a Christian, the two cannot be equated and it is not only deeply offense, but also shows, sadly, just how out of touch and little understanding secular society has.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>As posted on twitter earlier this year, I had intended on entering the UK Barista Championship's Northern Ireland Heat, this Wednesday and Thursday in Hillsborough and as posted last week on twitter, I had changed my mind. The reason? As much I would like to think otherwise, not working in a retail environment is a serious detriment to a barista's skill set. Everything from speed, workflow and consistency can all suffer from lack of practice and as mentioned in this post title, my latte art, especially, is a massive fail.<br /><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/aaae264056.jpg" alt="Brasilia Belle Epoque" title="Brasilia Belle Epoque" width="225" height="300"><br />In the coffee shop environment I previously worked in, we used the machine below, a Basilia Belle Epoque, 2 Group. Although suffering from relatively small boiler size due to the vertical design there was enough pressure to run both groups and steam milk at the same time, for a fairly consistent period of time. Even though it was recommended <a href="http://www.brasilia-coffee.co.uk/belle-epoque.html">here</a> that it should not be used on a busy site, we rarely experienced problems.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now at home I use a different setup, a Fracino Little Gem, 1 Group which I will admit is a pretty basic Prosumer machine and frequently has trouble with pressure, even still when you have the right workflow it is possible to brew and then steam without any detriment to the flavour of the cup. One major difference in this setup, that really doesn't help is the steam wand on the Fracino. I don't know if it's just me, but combined with my lack of practice, I don't seem to be able to get the same spin on the milk, regardless of which type of jug I use. And as any experienced Barista will tell you, its the spin of the milk, while stretching and steaming that creates the necessary texture to mix the milk and espresso and create impressive latte art. Latte art, which off-late has been disastrous on my part.<br /><img alt="" src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/14daa5e5ce.jpg" title="Home Setup" width="250">I've seen latte art created when using domestic krups machines, means I really doubt it's impossible, but it really goes to show, just how much your experience on a particular machine contributes to what you can do with it and with this year's UKBC having switched to Sanremo machines. Come Wednesday, I'll be at Hillsborough, unofficially reporting on the regional heat and will hopefully get to speak to a few of our local baristas and ask them how the changes this year have affected them to what lengths they have went to level the playing field. Maybe if you are good at what you do, the machine won't make a difference, in which case, hopefully I'll  pick up a few tips.</p>

         	<p>On some recent trip to Belfast's shiny new Apple Store, I took a walk down <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=anne+street+belfast&amp;sll=54.587886,-5.939179&amp;sspn=0.047447,0.152264&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=54.600424,-5.925772&amp;spn=0.005631,0.019033&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=J">Anne Street</a> (what is with the ugly half tile, have pot-holed tarmac street btw?) and found an absolute gem of a shop, The Cookie Box.<br /><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/1e3b5d4aac.jpg" alt="cookie-monster" title="cookie-monster" width="300" height="290"><br />Now I know this blog is generally about coffee (or what passes as coffee) but to be honest I've never even tried any of the coffee there, because even walking past I was stopped in my tracks by the sights and smells of about a dozen different varieties of home made cookies. It's only a small shop, opposite Forbidden Planet, and most of the room is taken up by the kitchen, almost putting the counter on the street itself, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in taste. <a name="more"></a> Crunchy but soft, gooey chocolate chips, oodles of butteryness making the cookies literally melt in your mouth. I'm sitting here and I can't even think of words to describe them, all that comes to mind, over and over again is the phrase:<br /><br />Best. Cookies. Ever.<br /><br />The owner works there and bakes the cookies himself. I know from my own experience how difficult working in that sort of environment can be so I wish him and his business all the possible success they can have. I for one will be back, again, next time I'm in Belfast and I think everyone else should too.<br /><br />Go Cookie Man Go!</p>

         	<p>First off, happy new year, I hope you've all had a restful time lately, it's been great, getting to put my feet up and take a break from computers for a few days.</p>  <p>Some of you may have noticed, my reviews of coffee shops have been a little thin on the ground of late. I haven't been slacking, however, as I have whole list of new reviews, instead I've decided to take a small hiatus until the new collaborative review site is finished. I've been told I can be quite negative and critical sometimes, if not downright nasty and as passionate as I am about coffee, that's not me. So while I work on the new site I'm also restructuring my reviews to be more informative and helpful. The end goal? A one-stop-shop where everything, from the espresso to the environment where it is served can be rated not only by me, but by the general public too. Need to know where you can get a 6oz cappuccino, a free wifi connection and is kid friendly? Well so do I, so when I find it, it'll be on the map :-) You get the idea.</p>  <p>I'm still wrestling with the idea to set the reviews site up as a separate website, so if anyone has any good ideas for a name, they'd be greatly appreciated and your genius will of course be credited. There really isn't any reason to limit something like this to Northern Ireland, so anyone with speciality coffee experience, in other regions, who would like to volunteer should look no further than the comments box below, or contact me on andrew [at] exilecoffee.com</p>

         	<p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/ec2d634e34.jpg" height="285" width="380">I like Starbucks. There, I said it. I'm sure <a href="http://www.hasbean.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve</a> will be spiking my next coffee order and I'll have to start sleeping with my eyes open, but there is no denying the truth. In my defense, however, it is not for the reasons you may think. I'm not a slave to the corporate machine, I'm not a caffeine junkie, I don't like huge sizes and I certainly don't want a shot of vanilla and whipped cream in my cappuccino. The many faults of Starbucks, which have been flogged to death all over the web, are superfluous to my reasons. I want to focus on a few changes over the last year and whether or not they are nothing more than marketing ploys; the introduction of the <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.time.com%2Ftime%2Fbusiness%2Farticle%2F0%2C8599%2C1729520%2C00.html&amp;ei=ulBKSZTnPJTM0QTurrC1Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPFn6FSZd37bTxaQkobcgVD8XcgQ&amp;sig2=WyL3iB4K1tDNtH0OweFqyw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Pike Place Roast'</a> in the USA and the switching to <a href="http://theshot.coffeeratings.com/2008/11/starbucks-uk-coffee-fairtrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fair Trade in the UK</a>.</p>  <p><a name="more"></a></p>  <p>Fact, here are over 15000 Starbucks in the world! - <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_Starbucks%27_are_there_in_the_world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WikiAnswers</a><br />They may have gone off message since opening their doors, but Starbucks is the largest coffee chain in the world. That may be a negative to some people, but try to consider what the world of coffee was without Starbucks. Have a look in any 'greasy spoon' cafe in the UK and you will see the remnants of the old way of doing things, filter pots left on the hotplate all day, Nescafe instant in bulk quantities, espresso, if it can be called that, from dirty machines and oily beans. The sort of thing we see in the very worst of coffee shops, where coffee is not considered a culinary product, but just another commodity to sell. With the spread of Starbucks has come the spread of coffee shop and most importantly, espresso culture. It's very unlikely that you favourite coffee house today would exist without the legitimacy given to gourmet coffee by Starbucks. You can't buy marketing like that, well you can, they did...</p>  <p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/7e5b1c0abb.jpg" height="236" align="left" width="150">Howard Schultz, taking a leaf from Steve Jobs' book, has returned to the company and earlier this year, announced a series of changes, bringing back manual machines, shorter times keeping brewed coffee and the Pike Place Blend, roasted and delivered to stores within two weeks of brewing. Recognising and attempting to fix mistakes is a quality which in business these days, is avoided like the plague. Pike Place Roast which for anyone unaware and/or leaving outside the US, is a new house blend with a much more palatable roast profile. Whereas the older 'House Blend' was infamous for being darkly roasted and tasting &quot;charred,&quot; Pike Place (named after Starbucks original location in Seattle) is a little lighter roasted and from my own experiences this summer, a bit sweeter and more balanced. Along with the new blend comes the obligatory rebrand of cups and store cards bearing the original logo (more or less) and a reemphasis on freshness, which is when <em>I</em> started taking notice. </p>  <p><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/695154139c.jpg" height="88" align="right" width="100">I bought a 1lb of Pike place back in August and even after a week or two it was still enjoyable. During that time I grabbed a bag of House Blend from my local Starbucks, in Belfast and brewed it up using the same method as the Pike Place. For some reason which I have yet to understand, I didn't actually make any hard notes during this time, not very scientific I know, but I can say with certainty that even 'freshly' out of the bag, the House Blend already tasted like &quot;burnt tarmac.&quot;</p>  <p>It left me hoping that Starbucks Europe would make a similar move, but the logistics of roasting and transport within Europe would be more challenging than in the US. That said, if <a href="http://coffeecollective.blogspot.com/">The Coffee Collective</a> can do it, why can't Starbucks?</p>  <p>Speaking of Europe, that brings me back to their other big change, switching to Fairtrade, across their range, in the UK. There has been plenty written about Fairtrade and its branding, how it's not actually as fair as it makes out; the speciality industry has touted the direct trade and relationship coffee as viable alternatives, that give more, financially and technically, back to the producers. You can find articles on fair trade <a href="http://www.coffeearticles.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PagEd&amp;file=index&amp;topic_id=0&amp;page_id=84">here</a>, <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/origin/directtrade">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pickledpolitics.com/archives/2546">here</a>, to name a few. </p>  <p>Unlike the Pike Place Roast and improvements in quality and freshness, the Fairtrade switch seems to be more marketing genius, than helping farmers. However that is only my speculation and in turn, my dilemma. The real effect of both these changes remain unseen. The important thing is, that no matter where we stand on the Fairtrade issue, we need to make sure that ethical buying is not to salve our own conscience, but is because we care about our fellow man.</p>  <p><br /></p>

         	<p><a href="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/504a5f1c57.jpg"><img src="http://grib.co/uploads/2021/504a5f1c57.jpg" height="200" align="left" width="300"></a>My wife and I recently returned from a short break to Nice on the Cote D'azur (you have to love those cheap Ryanair flights) and I thought I should mention the copious amounts of coffee, drank on the trip. European, primarily Italian coffee holds a fabled place in the hearts of coffee aficionados, with good reason, with Italy being seen as the birthplace of the espresso and so on. Cafe culture in the south of France has a very similar feel to that of north Italy (random tour bus fact, Nice was the birthplace of the Italian unifier Garibaldi and almost became part of Italy). Walk into any cafe, restaurant, patisserie (of which there were many) and you will find a well used, sometimes quite rustic, espresso machine taking a pride of place on the counter. <a name="more"></a>Asking for a coffee, in most of France or Italy, will get you a single shot espresso as standard (un caf√© sil'vous plait,) which can be quite humorous when you see the looks on the faces of ignorant tourists who are expecting a full mug of filter. In a tourist hotspot like Nice this has the affect of the Barista second guessing your order, if they detect you are from out of town, pale skin and a bad accent being dead giveaways. </p>  <p>The espresso itself changes in taste and quality from shop to shop, as it does in the rest of the world, but overall was surprising good. As I mentioned above, shots are almost always singles, a rarity to find in the UK where most espresso is pulled as a double. Single shots can be tricky and are generally less forgiving than double or even triples and as such are shied away from. A single shot in a milk drink will also be very weak unless in a small (5-6 fl oz) cup, which are also rare to find in UK coffee, mostly because the public feel that a small size is because the shop owner is being tight instead of authentic. Because of the single shots I had expected to get some terrible coffee but it was obvious from the word go that the baristas here knew about coffee, knew how to make it and although relaxed in their nature, cared about what they were making, much as making a good pot of tea is part of a way of life for older generation in Britain. </p>  <p>I've read online, (if you know where please let me know) possibly at coffee geek, that European machines generally run at a different temperature and pressure than our machines, resulting in a difference in the shot. I'd be interested to hear any theories on european coffee and why we don't run our machines this way, as it seems to give a much more pleasant cup. </p>  <p>PS. I've made quite a generalisation above and omitted any details on beans and/or roast profiles, quite frankly because I don't have any. All I can say is that beans weren't as dark or as oily as I would have expected.</p>  <p><br /></p>

I'm not sure if it's available online, but it actually seems like a very balanced article, going into the potential expense and &quot;over thinking&quot; that can go into producing latte art. It even mentions our very own James Hoffman, and his crazy latte art challenge, among other famous names, David Schomer and Mark Prince etc. I'm still shocked that they found a place for a story like this on a front page otherwise dedicated to the ongoing conflict in Georgia. More news from the colonies is on it's way; Ive been to Starbucks to try their new Pike Place roast. Andrew</p>  <p></p>  <p><br /></p>

This wasn't some young college kid, but an older Hispanic lady, who is very pleasant and upbeat, (although in Florida it's uncertain just how real the pleasantries really are). The trainer was a young well dressed White woman, whom I assume is from the local head office; I have ran, participated in and evaesdropped on enough Batista training sessions to know the way she was talking to this lady was in no way appropriate regardless of her competancy in making coffee. Talking down to and criticising someone to colleagues via the phone, infront of both the trainee herself and customers is wrong, there is nothing else to say about it. Hopefully she'll make it through the retraining and may I suggest the head office staff could do with some retraining on manners! Andrew </p>  <p></p>  <p><br /></p>

         	<p>I hope you've got your glasses nice and full, there's a whole stack of toasts coming! We'd like to thank you all for coming today, it wouldn't have been half the day it was without our friends and family around us, so thank you.</p>  <p>We'd also like to thank our bridal party for their help today, for the bridesmaids, Tanya and Lousie, our ushers Brian and Richard, my groomsman Ashley, Kyle for his reading, to Jessica for singing and of course Mark, my best man. Just remember bro, go easy on me in your speech. The advantage of getting married first is that I can repay the favour when its your turn! I'd like you to raise your glasses and toast the wedding party.</p>  <p>A big thank you goes to both my mum and dad and my new mother and father in law, who have so warmly welcomed me into their family. The love and support from both our parents and the Godly homes that we have grown up in, have made a huge impact on both our lives and is part of the reason that we both know the Lord today. Lets raise our glasses to our parents</p>  <p>Of course then we have the most important person of the day, Lila, who, Im sure you'll all agree looks absolutely stunning.</p>  <p>As I'm sure you all know Lila and I are both saved, and Church has been and is an important part of our lives, infact Lila and I first met in church, all those years ago, but of course being a typical teenage boy, I had very interest in girls and am sorry to say didn't really notice her. But as you know Lila likes to get her way and eventually, after a few years, I noticed her, which goes to show, persistence pays off. We started going out on the 6th of September 2003, after¬† bravely asked her out via text message. I was a bit more brave when it came to proposing however, I did that in person! However any rumours that some people might spread. about how the shock put Lewis in hospital are completely untrue. I want to thank Lila for agreeing to marry me, I'm still not sure what I did right to make her say yes, but she did and now today I feel like I'm the happiest man in the world. So please everybody raise your glasses in a toast to Lila</p>  <p>Finally I'd like to thank our Lord and Saviour for all the help and strength he has given us over the years and would hope, now that we are married that we can now walk together, united in Him.</p>  <p>Thank you</p>

And since that time I've been patiently waiting for a native Wordpress application that would rival the TypePad app; yesterday was to be that day, or was it. Although not quite as disappointed with it as <a href="http://cimota.com/blog/2008/07/23/wordpress-for-iphone-relegated/">@cimota</a>, there still are bugs to be worked out, like why I had to reinstall my blog to get it to work. I'm also concerned with my comment on the <a href="http://iphone.wordpress.org/report-issues/">support  site</a> is still unapproved, are they trying to hide their bugs?<br /><br />Regardless I'll stick with it for a while yet, I'm hoping for a quantum leap in features for version 1.1, in the way that Facebook 1.1 improved on it's initial false start.<br /><br />Andrew</p>

Does that mean a lot less money to spend on &quot;unnecesary luxuries&quot; like a good cup of coffee?<br /><br />Not so, making good coffee doesn't have to cost the earth, use a lot of electricity on fancy equipment or even create a mess. When we take coffee brewing back to its most simple form, you not only save money but you might actually find it tastes better too!<br /><br />The photo attached shows you everything you need for a simple cup of &quot;pour over&quot; coffee; standard kitchen funnel, filter paper (or a mesh filter from a home coffee machine), coffee in an air tight container and a mug, all you need to add is hot water.<br /><br />For one cup of coffee all you need is a desert spoon's worth of coarsely ground coffee (remember to only grind what you need, or use fresh pre-ground), put the paper filter in the funnel, add coffee and pour in your hot water, stir the grounds and add hot water until there is enough in your cup an thats it! <br /><br />And it doesn't end there, anything left in the filter can be poured down the sink, helping keep your drain clear (yes coffee grounds are actually good for your pipes!) and the filter paper can be added to you compost pile if you have one. So there you go, you get a nice cup of coffee, save money, time and effort and help the environment too, what better way to start the day?<br /><br />Andrew<br /><br /></p>

         	<p>I remember, at least I think I remember, (it could have been on televison), a time when staff in a shop were there to help and assist you, even if they were only after a sale. Fast-forward to the brave new world we live in and you'll find the majority of shop staff are no longer there to help you or their company; <a name="more"></a>take a look around, most shop staff are under enthused, spoilt teenagers, who are only there to fund their weekend binge drinking/smoking/drugs/child support payments and have no interest in what they do because they can easily move another cushy seemingly brainless job with ease.<br /><br />I'm not knocking all teenagers, nor am I saying the jobs are brainless, but it does seem that there are a lot of them and they really don't care. Whether it was the girl in subway who was disgusted and refused to put mayo on a meatball sub, the staff in Burtons who won't help you find a product, or the cafe worker who refuses to make a cappuccino cooler, because &quot;that's how the machine does it&quot; you all know who you are! If you find yourself reading this, no I am not a grumpy old man, but just think how you'd like to be treated in a shop, that's how <em>you</em> should be treating others. It's an age old ideal, but is as relevant today as ever.<br /><br />Andrew</p>

         	<p>I hope to attend <a href="http://barcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCampBelfast">BarCamp Belfast</a> this month, held in QUB on 21st June. BarCamp, for anyone that doesn't know, is a sort of un-conference, where people gather together &quot;to share and learn in an open environment.&quot; To take the concept one step further I think of it as an &quot;analog&quot; wiki of sorts. Attendees arrange among themselves, before hand and during the event, who will speak and on what topic. Its like a 21st Century Quaker IT meeting.<br /><br />I think its a great idea for people in similar fields to meet together and share their knowledge, ideas and have a bit of craic. Just look around the Web (2.0) today and you can see so much openness, with open APIs allowing unparalleled integration of apps. Collaboration spurs innovation!<br /><br />If you <i>still</i> dont' know what I'm talking about, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">Wikipedia is your friend.</a><br /><br />Andrew</p>

The result being that I ended up pulling drinks WBC style, in batches of four, both espresso and cappuccino and having three members of the family evaluate, based on body, flavour, sweetness, acidity etc. I drank the remaining drinks, so they wouldn‚Äôt go to waste <img src="http://archive.andrewgribben.com/oldblog/oldblog/oldblog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt="-)"></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>We sampled <a href="http://coffeecollective.blogspot.com/">Coffee Collective‚Äôs Espresso Blend</a>, <a href="http://http://www.ristrettocoffee.com">Ristretto Coffee‚Äôs Espresso Blend</a>, <a href="http://http://www.hasbean.co.uk">Has Bean‚Äôs El Salvador Finca La Siberia</a> and my ‚ÄúProletariat Blend.‚Äù In hindsight, I wish I‚Äôd ordered Has Bean‚Äôs Espresso Blend, to make this a fair test; the La Siberia is in a league of its own as far as I‚Äôm concerned, it‚Äôs a wonderful example of a single-origin espresso and stood out to all the family as something different, although some noted it may actually have been too sweet and bright for cappuccino. </p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>I won‚Äôt get into specifics, although I know that‚Äôs what you all want, but I was pleased to find my blend could almost hold its own against the pros, even after roasting the Sumatran component too dark. No surprise that The Coffee Collective came out on top, these guys have created a wonderfully balanced and sweet blend that lends itself to milk drinks. Ristretto are locally based and are making serious inroads into the stagnant Northern Ireland coffee industry, their blend itself is very Northern Irish, quite a heavy body with a touch of sweetness, its much closer to the expected ‚Äúcoffee taste‚Äù than something like the La Siberia. My blend, needs work, that‚Äôs the main point of this test. I feel the proportions are right and the choice to halve the Monsooned Malabar a few months back has allowed the fruity flavours in the other beans to come through, its also quite well balanced as a straight espresso. In the next few weeks, look out for part 3, where I‚Äôll be running the same test on some high end commercial machines to see the difference in taste.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>Andrew</p>

         	<p>Not just confused, but kinda dirty too. Why? Because I‚Äôve just been in Starbucks and I really enjoyed it! <span></span></p> <a name="more"></a><br /><p>I popped in to the new Victoria Square store to make use of their wifi for wedding planning purposes, ordered my usual small cappuccino, not too hot. I made a point to ask them not to heat the milk too high as opposed to adding cold milk and to my surprised they had no problem sticking it to the man, so to speak. The result? A not half bad cup of coffee! (My Victoria Square review is still a work in progress so this is not a review.) Not only was the coffee good but they were some of the most friendly and talkative (in a good way) coffee shop staff I have met in a long time. </p> <br /><p>It‚Äôs such a good location too, lovely view, plenty if comfy seats, open wifi from somewhere nearby as well as their own t-mobile wifi and late openings. I have to say I really enjoyed myself and I‚Äôve came to a shocking realisation of just how big a snob I am. Which makes it even more pleasing to find such gems in the rough. I for one will be back. (Until Clement‚Äôs start opening their York Street store late, that is)</p>

         	<p>Northern Ireland is a land which in the past has been blessed of God, but living here ourselves we may not fully realise the extent of the blessing. It only takes one look to the British mainland or south to the Irish Republic to see how previously God fearing lands are in the grip of ‚Äúevangelical‚Äù atheism, militant Islam, and worse, complete indifference and apathy. Apathy so bad that many adults have never been to church even as a child. When speaking to people in Northern Ireland is is generally assumed that they have had some sort of church upbringing; Protestant and Catholic alike will have heard <span>Bible stories and know who Jesus was. But without any ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù orientation in a life, a person will see the message you bring, of God's salvation as a strange alien concept. </span></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>Religion, especially Christianity is a taboo subject; atheists blame as the source of all the World's problems, a view taken up by many throughout the land. And to this background our message seems as bizarre and ridiculous as that brought by many cults like Scientology, whose beliefs we find laughable.A different approach must be taken to not just witness, but to educate as to what we witness about. Yes, we can live our life as a living testimony of what God has done for us, but if someone asked us why we lived in that way, telling them we are saved because Jesus died to save us from their sins, would seem as religious technobabble. It is a challenging problem, to understand this mind set, and find a way best suitable to witnessing to those with it, which will take much prayer and patience.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>We must also pray that the plague of apathy does not take root here in Northern Ireland, for the seeds have already been sown, parents no longer send their children out to Church or Sunday School and the association of Biblical Christianity with the Catholic Church due to the Ecumenical movement, has tarnished our reputation.We must witness to the young now while there still remains a generation that are willing to hear, for once the foundation of youth has been removed the church will crumble. God forbif we would let that happen.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p></p>  <p><br /></p>  <p><span><span>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</span></span><span> Mark 16:15,16</span></p>

         	<p>I was very impressed yesterday to find a special iPhone formatted page on sermonaudio.com.<br /><br />SermonAudio have some great sermons in audio and video format, but until recently has been very much the domain of Windows Media users, with basic only podcast support and wmv video. Gradually over the past year they're support for iTunes and Web2.0 standards has been on the up; now with iPhone and iPod Touch support you can browse sermons on specially formatted pages, listen via Edge and watch video over wifi.<br /><br />Anything that makes a site more accessible is a good thing in my book, although this feature may only appeal to geeks like me. Either way its a great addition to an already great resource.<br /><br />Andrew</p>
